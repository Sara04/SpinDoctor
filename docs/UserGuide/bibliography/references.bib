  abstract = {Objective: Effective connectivity (EC) is the methodology
              for determining functional-integration among the
              functionally active segregated regions of the brain. By
              definition [1] EC is “the causal influence exerted by one
              neuronal group on another” which is constrained by
              anatomical connectivity (AC) (axonal connections). AC is
              necessary for EC but does not fully determine it, because
              synaptic communication occurs dynamically in a
              context-dependent fashion. Although there is a vast
              emerging evidence of structure-function relationship using
              multimodal imaging studies, till date only a few studies
              have done joint modeling of the two modalities: functional
              MRI (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). We aim to
              propose a unified probabilistic framework that combines
              information from both sources to learn EC using dynamic
              Bayesian networks (DBNs). Method: DBNs are probabilistic
              graphical temporal models that learn EC in an exploratory
              fashion. Specifically, we propose a novel anatomically
              informed (AI) score that evaluates fitness of a given
              connectivity structure to both DTI and fMRI data
              simultaneously. The AI score is employed in structure
              learning of DBN given the data. Results: Experiments with
              synthetic-data demonstrate the face validity of structure
              learning with our AI score over anatomically uninformed
              counterpart. Moreover, real-data results are
              cross-validated by performing classification-experiments.
              Conclusion: EC inferred on real fMRI-DTI datasets is found
              to be consistent with previous literature and show
              promising results in light of the AC present as compared to
              other classically used techniques such as
              Granger-causality. Significance: Multimodal analyses
              provide a more reliable basis for differentiating brain
              under abnormal/diseased conditions than the single modality
              analysis.},

  abstract = {Diffusion-weighted MRI measures the direction and scale of
              the local diffusion process in every voxel through its
              spectrum in q -space, typically acquired in one or more
              shells. Recent developments in microstructure imaging and
              multi-tissue decomposition have sparked renewed attention
              in the radial b -value dependence of the signal.
              Applications in motion correction and outlier rejection,
              therefore, require a compact linear signal representation
              that extends over the radial as well as angular domain.
              Here, we introduce SHARD, a data-driven representation of
              the q$ -space signal based on spherical harmonics and a
              radial decomposition into orthonormal components. This
              representation provides a complete, orthogonal signal
              basis, tailored to the spherical geometry of q -space, and
              calibrated to the data at hand. We demonstrate that the
              rank-reduced decomposition outperforms model-based
              alternatives in human brain data, while faithfully
              capturing the micro- and meso-structural information in the
              signal. Furthermore, we validate the potential of joint
              radial-spherical as compared with single-shell
              representations. As such, SHARD is optimally suited for
              applications that require low-rank signal predictions, such
              as motion correction and outlier rejection. Finally, we
              illustrate its application for the latter using outlier
              robust regression.},

  abstract = {ObjectivObjective: A new method for fitting
              Diffusion-Weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DW-MRI) data
              composed of an unknown number of multi-exponential
              components is presented and evaluated. Methods: The
              Auto-regressive Discrete Acquisition Points Transformation
              (ADAPT) method is an adaption of the auto-regressive moving
              average system, which allows for the modelling of
              multi-exponential data and enables the estimation of the
              number of exponential components without prior assumptions.
              ADAPT was evaluated on simulated DW-MRI data. The optimum
              ADAPT fit was then applied to human brain DWI data and the
              correlation between the ADAPT coefficients and the
              parameters of the commonly used bi-exponential Intravoxel
              Incoherent Motion (IVIM) method were investigated. Results:
              The ADAPT method can correctly identify the number of
              components and model the exponential data. The ADAPT
              coefficients were found to have strong correlations with
              the IVIM parameters. ADAPT(1,1)-β0 correlated with IVIM-D:
              ρ=0.708, P <0.001. ADAPT(1,1)-α1 correlated with IVIM-f:
              ρ=0.667, P <0.001. ADAPT(1,1)-β1 correlated with IVIM-D*:
              ρ=0.741, P <0.001). Conclusion: ADAPT provides a method
              that can identify the number of exponential components in
              DWI data without prior assumptions, and determine potential
              complex diffusion biomarkers. Significance: ADAPT has the
              potential to provide a generalized fitting method for
              discrete multi-exponential data, and determine meaningful
              coefficients without prior information.},

              We show that surface-to-volume ratio can be significantly

  abstract  = {Repetitive brain stimulation is an established
               experimental protocol that induces plasticity in the
               stimulated site. Recent evidence indicates additional
               plasticity-related changes in remote nonstimulated regions.
               However, the neural substrates underlying the remote
               effects are unknown. Diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) probes
               water diffusion and can be used to estimate morphological
               changes in cortical tissue that occur with the induction of
               plasticity. We used DWI to evaluate morphological changes
               induced by repetitive brain stimulation in human brains.
               Our results reveal that synchronized fluctuations in the
               morphology of microstructures between stimulated and remote
               regions might form identify networks that allow retention
               of plasticity-related morphological changes in remote
               regions. These results increase our understanding of the
               effects of stimulation-induced plasticity on multiple brain
               regions.Repetitive brain stimulation protocols induce
               plasticity in the stimulated site in brain slice models.
               Recent evidence from network models has indicated that
               additional plasticity-related changes occur in
               nonstimulated remote regions. Despite increasing use of
               brain stimulation protocols in experimental and clinical
               settings, the neural substrates underlying the additional
               effects in remote regions are unknown. Diffusion-weighted
               MRI (DWI) probes water diffusion and can be used to
               estimate morphological changes in cortical tissue that
               occur with the induction of plasticity. Using DWI
               techniques, we estimated morphological changes induced by
               application of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation
               (rTMS) over the left primary motor cortex (M1). We found
               that rTMS altered water diffusion in multiple regions
               including the left M1. Notably, the change in water
               diffusion was retained longest in the left M1 and remote
               regions that had a correlation of baseline fluctuations in
               water diffusion before rTMS. We conclude that
               synchronization of water diffusion at rest between
               stimulated and remote regions ensures retention of
               rTMS-induced changes in water diffusion in remote regions.
               Synchronized fluctuations in the morphology of cortical
               microstructures between stimulated and remote regions might
               identify networks that allow retention of
               plasticity-related morphological changes in multiple
               regions after brain stimulation protocols. These results
               increase our understanding of the effects of brain
               stimulation-induced plasticity on multiregional brain
               networks. DWI techniques could provide a tool to evaluate
               treatment effects of brain stimulation protocols in
               patients with brain disorders.},

@article{assaf,
  abstract = {Abstract The diameter of a myelinated nerve axon is
              directly proportional to its conduction velocity, so the
              axon diameter distribution helps determine the channel
              capacity of nervous transmission along fascicles in the
              central (CNS) and peripheral nervous systems (PNS).
              Previously, this histological information could only be
              obtained using invasive tissue biopsies. Here we propose a
              new NMR-based approach that employs a model of water
              diffusion within “restricted” cylindrical axons to
              estimate their diameter distribution within a nerve bundle.
              This approach can be combined with MRI to furnish an
              estimate of the axon diameter distribution within each
              voxel. This method is validated by comparing the diameter
              distributions measured using the NMR and histological
              techniques on sciatic and optic nerve tissue specimens. The
              axon diameter distribution measured in each voxel of
              porcine spinal cord using MRI and using histological
              methods were similar. Applications are expected in
              longitudinal studies designed to follow nerve growth in
              normal and abnormal development, as well as in diagnosing
              disorders and diseases affecting specific populations of
              axons in the CNS and PNS. Magn Reson Med 59:1347–1354,

  abstract  = {High b value diffusion-weighted images sampled at high
               angular resolution were analyzed using a composite hindered
               and restricted model of diffusion (CHARMED). Measurements
               and simulations of diffusion in white matter using
               \{CHARMED\} provide an unbiased estimate of fiber
               orientation with consistently smaller angular uncertainty
               than when calculated using a \{DTI\} model or with a dual
               tensor model for any given signal-to-noise level. Images
               based on the population fraction of the restricted
               compartment provide a new contrast mechanism that enhances
               white matter like DTI. Nevertheless, it is assumed that
               these images might be more sensitive than \{DTI\} to white
               matter disorders. We also provide here an experimental
               design and analysis framework to implement \{CHARMED\}
               \{MRI\} that is feasible on human clinical scanners. },

  abstract  = {The technique used to spot information in Magnetic
               Resonance Imaging (MRI) uses electromagnetic fields. Even
               minor perturbations of these magnetic fields can disturb
               the imaging process and may render clinical images
               inaccurate or useless. Modelling and numerical simulation
               of the effects of static field inhomogeneities are now well
               established. Less attention has been paid to mathematical
               modelling of the effects of radio-frequency (RF) field
               inhomogeneities in the imaging process. When considering RF
               field inhomogeneities, the major difficulty is that the
               mathematical expression of the magnetisation vector is not
               anymore explicitly known in contrast with the unperturbed
               case. Indeed, the Bloch equation becomes an ordinary
               differential equation with nonconstant coefficients that
               cannot be solved analytically. The use of standard
               numerical schemes for ordinary differential equations to
               compute the magnetisation vector appears to be costly and
               not well suited for MRI image simulation. In this paper, we
               present an original method for solving the Bloch equation
               based on a truncated series expansion of the solution. The
               computational cost of the method reduces to the computation
               of the eigenelements of a block tridiagonal matrix of a
               very small size.},

  abstract  = {BackgroundÂ The basal ganglia contain the highest levels
               of iron in the brain, and postmortem studies indicate a
               disruption of iron metabolism in the basal ganglia of
               patients with Alzheimer disease (AD). Iron can catalyze
               free radical reactions and may contribute to oxidative
               damage observed in AD brains. Treatments aimed at reducing
               oxidative damage have offered novel ways to delay the rate
               of progression and could possibly defer the onset of AD.
               Brain iron levels were quantified in vivo using a new
               magnetic resonance imaging method.MethodsÂ Thirty-one
               patients with AD and 68 control subjects participated in
               this study. A magnetic resonance imaging method was
               employed that quantifies the iron content of ferritin
               molecules (ferritin iron) with specificity through the
               combined use of high and low field-strength magnetic
               resonance imaging instruments. Three basal ganglia
               structures (caudate, putamen, and globus pallidus) and one
               comparison region (frontal lobe white matter) were
               evaluated.ResultsÂ Basal ganglia ferritin iron levels were
               significantly increased in the caudate (P = .007; effect
               size, 0.69) and putamen (P = .008; effect size, 0.67) of AD
               subjects, with a trend toward an increase in the globus
               pallidus (P = .13). The increased basal ganglia ferritin
               iron levels were not a generalized phenomenon; white matter
               ferritin iron levels were unchanged in patients with AD (P
               = .50).ConclusionsÂ The data replicate and extend prior
               results and suggest that basal ganglia ferritin iron levels
               are increased in AD. Prospective studies are needed to
               evaluate whether premorbid iron levels are increased in
               individuals who develop AD.},

  abstract  = {This paper describes a new NMR imaging modality--MR
               diffusion tensor imaging. It consists of estimating an
               effective diffusion tensor, Deff, within a voxel, and then
               displaying useful quantities derived from it. We show how
               the phenomenon of anisotropic diffusion of water (or
               metabolites) in anisotropic tissues, measured noninvasively
               by these NMR methods, is exploited to determine fiber tract
               orientation and mean particle displacements. Once Deff is
               estimated from a series of NMR pulsed-gradient, spin-echo
               experiments, a tissue's three orthotropic axes can be
               determined. They coincide with the eigenvectors of Deff,
               while the effective diffusivities along these orthotropic
               directions are the eigenvalues of Deff. Diffusion
               ellipsoids, constructed in each voxel from Deff, depict
               both these orthotropic axes and the mean diffusion
               distances in these directions. Moreover, the three scalar
               invariants of Deff, which are independent of the tissue's
               orientation in the laboratory frame of reference, reveal
               useful information about molecular mobility reflective of
               local microstructure and anatomy. Inherently tensors (like
               Deff) describing transport processes in anisotropic media
               contain new information within a macroscopic voxel that
               scalars (such as the apparent diffusivity, proton density,
               T1, and T2) do not.},

  abstract  = {Neocortical circuits share anatomical and physiological
               similarities among different species and cortical areas.
               Because of this, a â€˜canonicalâ€™ cortical
               microcircuit could form the functional unit of the
               neocortex and perform the same basic computation on
               different types of inputs. However, variations in pyramidal
               cell structure between different primate cortical areas
               exist, indicating that different cortical areas could be
               built out of different neuronal cell types. In the present
               study, we have investigated the dendritic architecture of
               90 layer II/III pyramidal neurons located in different
               cortical regions along a rostrocaudal axis in the mouse
               neocortex, using, for the first time, a blind
               multidimensional analysis of over 150 morphological
               variables, rather than evaluating along single
               morphological parameters. These cortical regions included
               the secondary motor cortex (M2), the secondary
               somatosensory cortex (S2), and the lateral secondary visual
               cortex and association temporal cortex (V2L/TeA).
               Confirming earlier primate studies, we find that basal
               dendritic morphologies are characteristically different
               between different cortical regions. In addition, we
               demonstrate that these differences are not related to the
               physical location of the neuron and cannot be easily
               explained assuming rostrocaudal gradients within the
               cortex. Our data suggest that each cortical region is built
               with specific neuronal components.},

               state matrix and a relatively small number of inputs and
               outputs. The main contributions of this paper are numerical
               algorithms for the solution of large algebraic Lyapunov and
               Riccati equations and linear-quadratic optimal control
               problems, which arise from such systems. First, we review
               an alternating direction implicit iteration-based method to
               compute approximate low-rank Cholesky factors of the
               solution matrix of large-scale Lyapunov equations, and we
               propose a refined version of this algorithm. Second, a
               combination of this method with a variant of Newton's
               method (in this context also called Kleinman iteration)
               results in an algorithm for the solution of large-scale
               Riccati equations. Third, we describe an implicit version
               of this algorithm for the solution of linear-quadratic
               optimal control problems, which computes the feedback
               directly without solving the underlying algebraic Riccati
               equation explicitly. Our algorithms are efficient with
               respect to both memory and computation. In particular, they
               can be applied to problems of very large scale, where
               square, dense matrices of the system order cannot be stored
               in the computer memory. We study the performance of our

               neurodegenerative diseases is complex and, in many aspects,
               only partly understood, increased iron levels in
               pathologically relevant brain areas and iron-mediated
               oxidative stress seem to play a central role in many of
               them. Much has been learned from monogenetically caused
               disturbances of brain iron metabolism including
               pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration type 2,
               hereditary ferritinopathies affecting the basal ganglia,
               and aceruloplasminemia that may well be applied to the most
               common neurodegenerative disorders associated with brain
               iron accumulation including Parkinson disease and Alzheimer
               disease. Iron-mediated oxidative stress in
               neurodegenerative diseases caused by other genetic pathways
               like Huntington disease and Friedreich ataxia underscore
               the complex interaction of this trace metal and genetic
               variations. Therapeutical strategies derived from
               application of iron chelators in monogenetically caused

               oxidative stress diminishing substances in animal models of

  abstract  = {In this paper, we study a generalization of the
               Donoho–Johnstone denoising model for the case of the
               translation-invariant wavelet transform. Instead of
               soft-thresholding coefficients of the classical orthogonal
               discrete wavelet transform, we study soft-thresholding of
               the coefficients of the translation-invariant discrete
               wavelet transform. This latter transform is not an
               orthogonal transformation. As a first step, we construct a
               level-dependent threshold to remove all the noise in the
               wavelet domain. Subsequently, we use the theory of
               interpolating wavelet transforms to characterize the
               smoothness of an estimated denoised function. Based on the
               fact that the inverse of the translation-invariant discrete
               transform includes averaging over all shifts, we use

  abstract  = { Molecular diffusion and microcirculation in the capillary
               network result in a distribution of phases in a single
               voxel in the presence of magnetic field gradients. This
               distribution produces a spin-echo attenuation. The authors
               have developed a magnetic resonance (MR) method to image
               such intravoxel incoherent motions (IVIMs) by using
               appropriate gradient pulses. Images were generated at 0.5 T
               in a high-resolution, multisection mode. Diffusion
               coefficients measured on images of water and acetone
               phantoms were consistent with published values. Images
               obtained in the neurologic area from healthy subjects and
               patients were analyzed in terms of an apparent diffusion
               coefficient (ADC) incorporating the effect of all IVIMs.
               Differences were found between various normal and
               pathologic tissues. The ADC of in vivo water differed from
               the diffusion coefficient of pure water. Results were
               assessed in relation to water compartmentation in biologic
               tissues (restricted diffusion) and tissue perfusion.
               Nonuniform slow flow of cerebrospinal fluid appeared as a
               useful feature on IVIM images. Observation of these motions
               may significantly extend the diagnostic capabilities of MR
               imaging. },

               range of parameters in the living subject and provide
               exquisite spatial resolution. Here we first review the rise
               of MRI to its current clinical “state-of-the-art”
               status and then consider the future directions for this
               technique. The long-term impact on clinical practice of
               recent innovations in MRI scanner hardware and sequence
               design are also considered. Key changes in clinical
               practice that we predict for the coming 10 years include:
               a widespread shift to higher field imaging (3T); further
               improvements in MRI coil technology, including further
               increases in the number of channels; the introduction of
               ultra-short echo-time imaging; the introduction of combined
               modality methods (e.g. positron emission tomography
               (PET)-MRI and single photon emission CT (SPECT)-MRI); and
               significant advances in molecular MRI agents. Even after
               30 years of continuing developments in human MRI, the

               diagnostic MRI. },

  abstract  = {Several novel transgenic mouse models expressing different
               mutant APPs in combination with mutant PS1 have been
               developed. These models have been analyzed to investigate
               the formation and progressive alterations of dystrophic
               neurites (DNs) in relation to AÎ² deposits. In the most
               aggressive model, AÎ² deposits appear as early as 2.5
               months of age. Maturation of DNs was qualitatively quite
               similar among models and in some respect reminiscent of
               human AD pathology. From the onset of deposition, most if
               not all AÎ² deposits were decorated with a high number of
               APP-, ubiquitin-, and MnSOD-immunoreactive DNs.
               Phosphorylated Tau DNs, however, appeared at a much slower
               rate and were more restricted. Mitochondrial dysfunction
               markers were observed in DNs: the frequency and the density
               per deposit of DNs accumulating cytochrome c, cytochrome
               oxidase 1, and Bax progressively increased with age. Later,
               the burden of reactive DNs was reduced around large
               compact/mature deposits. In addition, the previously
               described phenomenon of early intraneuronal AÎ²
               accumulation in our models was associated with altered
               expression of APP protein as well as oxidative and
               mitochondrial stress markers occasionally in individual
               neurons. The present study demonstrates that oxidative and
               mitochondrial stress factors are present at several phases
               of AÎ² pathology progression, confirming the neuronal
               dysfunction in APP transgenic mice.},

  abstract  = {Deposition of iron in the brain is proposed to play a role
               in the pathophysiology of the normal aging process and
               neurodegenerative diseases. Whereas iron is required for
               normal neuronal metabolism, excessive levels can contribute
               to the formation of free radicals, leading to lipid
               peroxidation and neurotoxicity. Magnetic resonance imaging
               (MRI) is a powerful tool to detect excessive iron in the
               brain and longitudinally monitor changes in iron levels.
               Iron deposition is associated with a reduction in the T2
               relaxation time, leading to hypointensity on spin-echo and
               gradient-echo T2-weighted images. The MRI changes
               associated with iron deposition have been observed both in
               normal aging and in various chronic neurological diseases,
               including multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer disease, and
               Parkinson disease. Magnetic resonance imaging metrics
               providing information about iron concentrations include R2,
               R2â€², and R2*. The purpose of this review is to
               discuss the role of iron and its detection by MRI in
               various neurological disorders. We will review the basic
               biochemical properties of iron and its influence on MRI
               signal. We will also summarize the sensitivity and
               specificity of MRI techniques in detecting iron. The MRI
               and pathological findings pertaining to brain iron will be
               reviewed with respect to normal aging and a variety of
               neurological disorders. Finally, the biochemistry and
               pathophysiology surrounding iron, oxidative stress, free
               radicals, and lipid peroxidation in the brain will be
               discussed, including therapeutic implications. The
               potential role of iron deposition and its assessment by MRI
               provides exciting potential applications to the diagnosis,
               longitudinal monitoring, and therapeutic development for
               disorders of the brain.},

@article{budde2010,
  abstract  = {Diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) is a sensitive and reliable
               marker of cerebral ischemia. Within minutes of an ischemic
               event in the brain, the microscopic motion of water
               molecules measured with DWI, termed the apparent diffusion
               coefficient (ADC), decreases within the infarcted region.
               However, although the change is related to cell swelling,
               the precise pathological mechanism remains elusive. We show
               that focal enlargement and constriction, or beading, in
               axons and dendrites are sufficient to substantially
               decrease ADC. We first derived a biophysical model of
               neurite beading, and we show that the beaded morphology
               allows a larger volume to be encompassed within an
               equivalent surface area and is, therefore, a consequence of
               osmotic imbalance after ischemia. The DWI experiment
               simulated within the model revealed that intracellular ADC
               decreased by 79% in beaded neurites compared with the
               unbeaded form. To validate the model experimentally,
               excised rat sciatic nerves were subjected to stretching,
               which induced beading but did not cause a bulk shift of
               water into the axon (i.e., swelling). Beading-induced
               changes in cell-membrane morphology were sufficient to
               significantly hinder water mobility and thereby decrease
               ADC, and the experimental measurements were in excellent
               agreement with the simulated values. This is a
               demonstration that neurite beading accurately captures the
               diffusion changes measured in vivo. The results
               significantly advance the specificity of DWI in ischemia
               and other acute neurological injuries and will greatly aid
               the development of treatment strategies to monitor and
               repair damaged brain in both clinical and experimental
               settings.},

  abstract  = {Secondary flow vortical patterns in arterial curvatures
               have the potential to affect several cardiovascular
               phenomena, e.g., progression of atherosclerosis by altering
               wall shear stresses, carotid atheromatous disease, thoracic
               aortic aneurysms and Marfan's syndrome. Temporal
               characteristics of secondary flow structures vis-{\`a}-vis
               physiological (pulsatile) inflow waveform were explored by
               continuous wavelet transform (CWT) analysis of
               phase-locked, two-component, two-dimensional particle image
               velocimeter data. Measurements were made in a
               180{\textdegree} curved artery test section upstream of the
               curvature and at the 90{\textdegree} cross-sectional plane.
               Streamwise, upstream flow rate measurements were analyzed
               using a one-dimensional antisymmetric wavelet. Cross-stream
               measurements at the 90{\textdegree} location of the curved
               artery revealed interesting multi-scale, multi-strength
               coherent secondary flow structures. An automated process
               for coherent structure detection and vortical feature
               quantification was applied to large ensembles of PIV data.
               Metrics such as the number of secondary flow structures,
               their sizes and strengths were generated at every discrete
               time instance of the physiological inflow waveform. An
               autonomous data post-processing method incorporating
               two-dimensional CWT for coherent structure detection was
               implemented. Loss of coherence in secondary flow structures
               during the systolic deceleration phase is observed in
               accordance with previous research. The algorithmic approach
               presented herein further elucidated the sensitivity and
               dependence of morphological changes in secondary flow
               structures on quasiperiodicity and magnitude of temporal
               gradients in physiological inflow conditions.},

  abstract = {Interpreting brain diffusion MRI measurements in terms of
              neuronal structure at a micrometer level is an exciting
              unresolved problem. Here we consider diffusion transverse
              to a bundle of fibers, and show theoretically, as well as
              using Monte Carlo simulations and measurements in a phantom
              made of parallel fibers mimicking axons, that the time
              dependent diffusion coefficient approaches its macroscopic
              limit slowly, in a (ln t)/t fashion. The logarithmic
              singularity arises due to short range disorder in the fiber
              packing. We identify short range disorder in axonal fibers
              based on histological data from the splenium, and argue
              that the time dependent contribution to the overall
              diffusion coefficient from the extra-axonal water dominates
              that of the intra-axonal water. This dominance may explain
              the bias in measuring axon diameters in clinical settings.
              The short range disorder is also reflected in the
              asymptotically linear frequency dependence of the diffusion
              coefficient measured with oscillating gradients, in
              agreement with recent experiments. Our results relate the
              measured diffusion to the mesoscopic structure of neuronal
              tissue, uncovering the sensitivity of diffusion metrics to
              axonal arrangement within a fiber tract, and providing an

               phase evolution and Brownian migration events. Simple
               expressions are given for the case of the finite width
               gradient pulse PGSE experiment, the CPMG pulse train used
               in frequency-domain modulated gradient spin echo NMR, and
               the case of a sinusoidal waveform. The finite width
               gradient pulse PGSE and CPMG pulse trains are evaluated for
               the case of restricted diffusion between parallel
               reflecting planes. The former results agree precisely with
               published computer simulations while the latter calculation
               provides useful insight regarding the spectral density
               approach to impeded Brownian motion.},

  abstract  = {In this study, we evaluate the performance of a flow-based
               surface evolution fiber tracking algorithm by means of a
               physical anisotropic diffusion phantom with known
               connectivity. We introduce a novel speed function for
               surface evolution that is derived from either diffusion
               tensor (DT) data, high angular resolution diffusion (HARD)
               data, or a combined DT-HARD hybrid approach. We use the
               model-free q-ball imaging (QBI) approach for \{HARD\}
               reconstruction. The anisotropic diffusion phantom allows us
               to compare and evaluate the performance of different fiber
               tracking approaches in the presence of real imaging
               artifacts, noise, and subvoxel partial volume averaging of
               fiber directions. The surface evolution approach, using the
               full diffusion tensor as opposed to the principal diffusion
               direction (PDD) only, is compared to PDD-based line
               propagation fiber tracking. Additionally, \{DT\}
               reconstruction is compared to \{HARD\} reconstruction for
               fiber tracking, both using surface evolution. We show the
               potential for surface evolution using the full diffusion
               tensor to map connections in regions of subvoxel partial
               volume averaging of fiber directions, which can be
               difficult to map with PDD-based methods. We then show that
               the fiber tracking results can be improved by using high
               angular resolution reconstruction of the diffusion
               orientation distribution function in cases where the
               diffusion tensor model fits the data poorly. },

  abstract  = {Many linear viscoelastic materials show constitutive
               behavior involving fractional order derivatives. Linear,
               time invariant systems without memory have exponential
               decay in time but, contradictorily, not the power law decay
               associated with fractional derivatives. The physics
               literature has noted that apparently-non-exponential decays
               can be observed when several simultaneously decaying
               processes have closely spaced exponential decay rates. Many
               engineer-researchers interested in viscoelastic damping,
               however, seem unaware of these observations. In this letter
               I give an unoriginal explanation, but with a fresh
               engineering flavor, for the appearance of these fractional
               order derivatives. By this explanation, fractional order
               damping can be expected from many materials with
               sufficiently disordered dissipation mechanisms.},

               for solving structural dynamics problems. The new method,

               dissipation that can be controlled by the user. In
               particular, it is shown that the generalized-α method

               of the generalized-α method with other numerically
               dissipative time integration methods; these results
               highlight the improved performance of the new algorithm.

  abstract  = {<p>During general anesthesia it is crucial to control
               systemic hemodynamics and oxygenation levels. However,
               anesthetic agents can affect cerebral hemodynamics and
               metabolism in a drug-dependent manner, while systemic
               hemodynamics is stable. Brain-wide monitoring of this
               effect remains highly challenging. Because
               T<sub>2</sub>*-weighted imaging at ultra-high magnetic
               field strengths benefits from a dramatic increase in
               contrast to noise ratio, we hypothesized that it could
               monitor anesthesia effects on brain blood oxygenation. We
               scanned rat brains at 7T and 17.2T under general anesthesia
               using different anesthetics (isoflurane, ketamine-xylazine,
               medetomidine). We showed that the brain/vessels contrast in
               T<sub>2</sub>*-weighted images at 17.2T varied directly
               according to the applied pharmacological anesthetic agent,
               a phenomenon that was visible, but to a much smaller extent
               at 7T. This variation is in agreement with the mechanism of
               action of these agents. These data demonstrate that
               preclinical ultra-high field MRI can monitor the effects of
               a given drug on brain blood oxygenation level in the
               absence of systemic blood oxygenation changes and of any
               neural stimulation.</p>},

               used to infer micro-structural characteristics of cerebral
               white matter in human conditions, correlations between
               human in vivo DTI and histology have not been performed.
               Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) patients with mesial temporal
               sclerosis (MTS) have abnormal DTI parameters of the
               fimbria-fornix (relative to TLE patients without MTS) which
               are presumed to represent differences in axonal/myelin
               integrity. Medically intractable TLE patients who undergo
               temporal lobe resection including the fimbria-fornix
               provide a unique opportunity to study the anatomical
               correlates of water diffusion abnormalities in freshly
               excised tissue. Eleven patients with medically intractable
               TLE were recruited (six with and five without MTS) for
               presurgical DTI followed by surgical excision of a small
               specimen of the fimbria-fornix which was processed for
               electron microscopy. Blinded quantitative analysis of the
               microphotographs included axonal diameter, density and
               area, cumulative axon membrane circumference, and myelin
               thickness and area. As predicted by DTI the fimbria-fornix
               of TLE patients with MTS had increased extra-axonal
               fraction, and reduced cumulative axonal membrane
               circumference and myelin area. Consistent with the animal
               literature, water diffusion anisotropy over the crus of the
               fimbria-fornix was strongly correlated with axonal
               membranes (cumulative membrane circumference) within the
               surgical specimen (âˆ¼15% of what was analyzed with
               DTI). The demonstration of a correlation between histology
               and human in vivo DTI, in combination with the observation
               that in vivo DTI accurately predicted white matter
               abnormalities in a human disease condition, provides strong
               validation of the application of DTI as a noninvasive
               marker of white matter pathology.},

               decrease of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of
               water in the human brain visual cortex during activation by
               a black and white 8-Hz-flickering checkerboard. The ADC
               decrease was small (<1%), but significant and reproducible,
               and closely followed the time course of the activation
               paradigm. Based on the known sensitivity of diffusion MRI
               to cell size in tissues and on optical imaging studies that
               have revealed changes in the shape of neurons and glial
               cells during activation, the observed ADC findings have
               been tentatively ascribed to a transient swelling of
               cortical cells. These preliminary results suggest a new
               approach to produce images of brain activation with MRI
               from signals directly associated with neuronal activation,
               and not through changes in local blood flow.},

  abstract  = {Quantitative magnetic susceptibility mapping (QSM) has
               recently been introduced to provide a novel quantitative
               and local MRI contrast. However, the anatomical contrast
               represented by in vivo susceptibility maps has not yet been
               compared systematically and comprehensively with gradient
               (recalled) echo (GRE) magnitude, frequency, and R2â?Ž
               images. Therefore, this study compares high-resolution
               quantitative susceptibility maps with conventional GRE
               imaging approaches (magnitude, frequency, R2â?Ž) in
               healthy individuals at 7 T with respect to anatomic tissue
               contrast. Volumes-of-interest were analyzed in deep and
               cortical gray matter (GM) as well as in white matter (WM)
               on R2â?Ž and susceptibility maps. High-resolution
               magnetic susceptibility maps of the human brain exhibited
               superb contrast that allowed the identification of
               substructures of the thalamus, midbrain and basal ganglia,
               as well as of the cerebral cortex. These were consistent
               with histology but not generally visible on magnitude,
               frequency or R2â?Ž-maps. Common target structures for
               deep brain stimulation, including substantia nigra pars
               reticulata, ventral intermediate nucleus, subthalamic
               nucleus, and the substructure of the internal globus
               pallidus, were clearly distinguishable from surrounding
               tissue on magnetic susceptibility maps. The laminar
               substructure of the cortical GM differed depending on the
               anatomical region, i.e., a cortical layer with increased
               magnetic susceptibility, corresponding to the Stria of
               Gennari, was found in the GM of the primary visual cortex,
               V1, whereas a layer with reduced magnetic susceptibility
               was observed in the GM of the temporal cortex. Both
               magnetic susceptibility and R2â?Ž values differed
               substantially in cortical GM depending on the anatomic
               regions. Regression analysis between magnetic
               susceptibility and R2â?Ž values of WM and GM structures
               suggested that variations in myelin content cause the
               overall contrast between gray and white matter on
               susceptibility maps and that both R2â?Ž and
               susceptibility values provide linear measures for iron
               content in GM. In conclusion, quantitative magnetic
               susceptibility mapping provides a non-invasive and
               spatially specific contrast that opens the door to the
               assessment of diseases characterized by variation in iron
               and/or myelin concentrations. Its ability to reflect
               anatomy of deep GM structures with superb delineation may
               be useful for neurosurgical applications.},

  abstract = {Biophysical modeling lies at the core of evaluating tissue
              cellular structure using diffusion-weighted MRI, albeit
              with shortcomings. The challenges lie not only in the
              complexity of the diffusion phenomenon, but also in the
              need to know the diffusion-specific properties of diverse
              cellular compartments in vivo. The likelihood function
              obtained from the commonly acquired Stejskal-Tanner
              diffusion-weighted MRI data is degenerate with different
              parameter constellations explaining the signal equally
              well, thereby hindering an unambiguous parameter
              estimation. The aim of this study is to measure the
              intra-axonal water diffusivity which is one of the central
              parameters of white matter models. Estimating intra-axonal
              diffusivity is complicated by (i) the presence of other
              compartments, and (ii) the orientation dispersion of axons.
              Our measurement involves an efficient signal suppression of
              water in extra-axonal space and all cellular processes
              oriented outside a narrow cone around the principal fiber
              direction. This is achieved using a planar water mobility
              filter that suppresses signal from all molecules that are
              mobile in the plane transverse to the fiber bundle. After
              the planar filter, the diffusivity of the remaining
              intra-axonal signal is measured using linear and spherical
              diffusion encoding. We find the average intra-axonal
              diffusivity D0=2.25±0.03μm2/ms for the timing of the
              applied gradients, which gives D0(∞)≈2.0μm2/ms when
              extrapolated to infinite diffusion time. The result imposes
              a strong limitation on the parameter selection for
              biophysical modeling of diffusion-weighted MRI.},

               differential operators. The main problems are the
               arithmetic complexity and the potentially high memory
               requirements when they are implemented on a computer. In a
               recent paper, Yuan and Agrawal have proposed an approach
               for operators of order Î±â€‰âˆˆâ€‰(0,1) that
               differs substantially from the standard methods. We extend
               the method to arbitrary Î±â€‰&gt;â€‰0, , and
               give an analysis of the main properties of this approach.
               In particular it turns out that the original algorithm
               converges rather slowly. Based on our analysis we are able
               to identify the source of this slow convergence and propose
               some modifications leading to a much more satisfactory
               behaviour. Similar results are obtained for a closely
               related method proposed by Chatterjee.},

               characterized by three parameters (membrane permeability P

  abstract  = {Abstract Alzheimer's disease (AD) as a neurodegenerative
               brain disorder is a devastating pathology leading to
               disastrous cognitive impairments and dementia, associated
               with major social and economic costs to society. Iron can
               catalyze damaging free radical reactions. With age, iron
               accumulates in brain frontal cortex regions and may
               contribute to the risk of AD. In this communication, we
               investigated the age-related brain iron load changes in the
               frontal cortex of 6- and 12-month-old C57BL/6J (C57) and
               APPswe/PS1Î”E9 (APP/PS1) double transgenic mouse by
               using graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry
               (GFAAS) and Perlsâ€™ reaction. In the present study,
               we also evaluated the age-related changes of \{DMT1\} and
               \{FPN1\} by using Western blot and qPCR. We found that
               compared with 6-month-old APP/PS1 mice and the 12-month-old
               \{C57\} mice, the 12-month-old APP/PS1 mice had increased
               iron load in the frontal cortex. The levels of \{DMT1\}
               were significantly increased and the \{FPN1\} were
               significantly reduced in the frontal cortex of the
               12-month-old APP/PS1 mice than that in the 6-month-old
               APP/PS1 mice and 12-month-old \{C57\} mice. We conclude
               that in \{AD\} damage occurs in conjunction with iron
               accumulation, and the brain iron load associated with loss
               control of the brain iron metabolism related protein
               \{DMT1\} and \{FPN1\} expressions. },

  abstract = {The matrix formalism is a general framework for evaluating
              the diffusion NMR signal from restricted spins under
              generalised gradient waveforms. The original publications
              demonstrate the method for waveforms that vary only in
              magnitude and have fixed orientation. In this work, we
              extend the method to allow for variations in the direction
              of the gradient. This extension is necessary, for example
              to incorporate the effects of crusher gradients or imaging
              gradients in diffusion MRI, to characterise signal
              anisotropy in double pulsed field gradient (dPFG)
              experiments, or to optimise the gradient waveform for
              microstructure sensitivity. In particular, we show for
              primitive geometries (planes, cylinders and spheres), how
              to express the matrix operators at each time point of the
              gradient waveform as a linear combination of one or two
              fundamental matrices. Thus we obtain an efficient
              implementation with both the storage and CPU demands
              similar to the fixed-orientation case. Comparison with
              Monte Carlo simulations validates the implementation on
              three different sequences: dPFG, helical waveforms and the
              stimulated echo (STEAM) sequence.},

  abstract = {Diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging enables the
              visualization of fibrous tissues such as brain white
              matter. The validation of this non-invasive technique
              requires phantoms with a well-known structure and diffusion
              behavior. This paper presents anisotropic diffusion
              phantoms consisting of parallel fibers. The diffusion
              properties of the fiber phantoms are measured using
              diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging and bulk NMR
              measurements. To enable quantitative evaluation of the
              measurements, the diffusion in the interstitial space
              between fibers is modeled using Monte Carlo simulations of
              random walkers. The time-dependent apparent diffusion
              coefficient and kurtosis, quantifying the deviation from a
              Gaussian diffusion profile, are simulated in 3D geometries
              of parallel fibers with varying packing geometries and
              packing densities. The simulated diffusion coefficients are
              compared to the theory of diffusion in porous media,
              showing a good agreement. Based on the correspondence
              between simulations and experimental measurements, the
              fiber phantoms are shown to be useful for the quantitative
              validation of diffusion imaging on clinical MRI-scanners.},

  abstract  = {Diffusional kurtosis imaging (DKI) is a clinically
               feasible extension of diffusion tensor imaging that probes
               restricted water diffusion in biological tissues using
               magnetic resonance imaging. Here we provide a physically
               meaningful interpretation of \{DKI\} metrics in white
               matter regions consisting of more or less parallel aligned
               fiber bundles by modeling the tissue as two non-exchanging
               compartments, the intra-axonal space and extra-axonal
               space. For the b-values typically used in DKI, the
               diffusion in each compartment is assumed to be anisotropic
               Gaussian and characterized by a diffusion tensor. The
               principal parameters of interest for the model include the
               intra- and extra-axonal diffusion tensors, the axonal water
               fraction and the tortuosity of the extra-axonal space. A
               key feature is that these can be determined directly from
               the diffusion metrics conventionally obtained with DKI. For
               three healthy young adults, the model parameters are
               estimated from the \{DKI\} metrics and shown to be
               consistent with literature values. In addition, as a
               partial validation of this DKI-based approach, we
               demonstrate good agreement between the DKI-derived axonal
               water fraction and the slow diffusion water fraction
               obtained from standard biexponential fitting to high
               b-value diffusion data. Combining the proposed \{WM\} model
               with \{DKI\} provides a convenient method for the clinical
               assessment of white matter in health and disease and could
               potentially provide important information on
               neurodegenerative disorders.},

              of MRI methods probing the brain microstructure. This
              review aims to provide guidelines on how to build,
              implement, or choose the right phantom for a particular
              application, along with an overview of the current
              state-of-the-art of phantoms dedicated to study brain
              microstructure with MRI. For physical phantoms, we discuss
              the essential requirements and relevant characteristics of
              both the (NMR visible) liquid and (NMR invisible) phantom
              materials that induce relevant microstructural features
              detectable via MRI, based on diffusion, intra-voxel
              incoherent motion, magnetization transfer or magnetic
              susceptibility weighted contrast. In particular, for
              diffusion MRI, many useful phantoms have been proposed,
              ranging from simple liquids to advanced biomimetic phantoms
              consisting of hollow or plain microfibers and capillaries.
              For numerical phantoms, the focus is on Monte Carlo
              simulations of random walk, for which the basic principles,
              along with useful criteria to check and potential pitfalls
              are reviewed, in addition to a literature overview
              highlighting recent advances. While many phantoms exist
              already, the current review aims to stimulate further

  abstract  = { IntraVoxel Incoherent Motion (IVIM) is a magnetic
               resonance imaging (MRI) technique capable of measuring
               perfusion-related parameters. In this manuscript, we show
               that the mono-exponential model commonly used to process
               IVIM data might be challenged, especially at short
               diffusion times. Eleven rat datasets were acquired at 7T
               using a diffusion-weighted pulsed gradient spin echo
               sequence with b-values ranging from 7 to 2500â€‰s/mm2
               at three diffusion times. The IVIM signals, obtained by
               removing the diffusion component from the raw MR signal,
               were fitted to the standard mono-exponential model, a
               bi-exponential model and the Kennan model. The Akaike
               information criterion used to find the best model to fit
               the data demonstrates that, at short diffusion times, the
               bi-exponential IVIM model is most appropriate. The results
               obtained by comparing the experimental data to a dictionary
               of numerical simulations of the IVIM signal in
               microvascular networks support the hypothesis that such a
               bi-exponential behavior can be explained by considering the
               contribution of two vascular pools: capillaries and
               somewhat larger vessels. },

               BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: DTI is an MR imaging measure of
               brain tissue integrity and provides an attractive metric
               for use in neuroprotection clinical trials. The purpose of
               our study was to use DTI to evaluate the longitudinal
               changes in brain tissue integrity in a group of patients
               with MS.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-one patients with MS
               starting natalizumab were imaged serially for 12 months.
               Gadolinium-enhancing lesions and 20 regions of interest
               from normal-appearing white and gray matter brain tissue
               were followed longitudinally. Average values within each
               region of interest were derived for FA, Î»âˆ¥,
               Î»âŠ¥, and MD. New T1 black holes were identified at
               12 months. Analysis was performed by using mixed-model
               regression analysis with slope (ie, DTI change per month)
               as the dependent variable.RESULTS: During 1 year, FA
               increased in gadolinium-enhancing lesions but decreased in
               NABT (P < .0001 for both). Changes in FA within
               gadolinium-enhancing lesions were driven by decreased
               Î»âŠ¥ (P < .001), and within NABT, by decreased
               Î»âˆ¥ (P < .0001). A higher Î»âŠ¥ within
               gadolinium-enhancing lesions at baseline predicted
               conversion to T1 black holes at 12 months. MD was unchanged
               in both gadolinium-enhancing lesions and NABT.CONCLUSIONS:
               We observed changes in DTI measures during 1 year in both
               gadolinium-enhancing lesions and NABT. The DTI results may
               represent possible remyelination within acute lesions and
               chronic axonal degeneration in NAWM. These results support
               the use of DTI as a measure of tissue integrity for studies
               of neuroprotective therapies.},

@article{fujiwara2014,
  abstract  = {Abstract Pathological iron deposits in the brain,
               especially within basal ganglia, are linked to severe
               neurodegenerative disorders like Parkinson's disease. As
               iron induces local changes in magnetic susceptibility, its
               presence can be visualized with magnetic resonance imaging
               (MRI). The usual approach, based on iron induced changes in
               magnetic relaxation (T2/T2â€²), is often prone,
               however, to confounding artifacts and lacks specificity.
               Here, we propose a new method to quantify and map iron
               deposits using water diffusion MRI. This method is based on
               the differential sensitivity of two image acquisition
               schemes to the local magnetic field gradients induced by
               iron deposits and their cross-term with gradient pulses
               used for diffusion encoding. Iron concentration could be
               imaged and estimated with high accuracy in the brain
               cortex, the thalamus, the substantia nigra and the globus
               pallidus of macaques, showing iron distributions in
               agreement with literature. Additionally, iron maps could
               clearly show a dramatic increase in iron content upon
               injection of an UltraSmall Particle Iron Oxide (USPIO)
               contrast agent, notably in the cortex and the thalamus,
               reflecting regional differences in blood volume. The method
               will benefit clinical investigations on the effect of iron
               deposits in the brain or other organs, as iron deposits are
               increasingly seen as a biomarker for a wide range of
               diseases, notably, neurodegenerative diseases in the
               pre-symptomatic stage. It also has the potential for
               quantifying variations in blood volume induced by brain
               activation in fMRI studies using USPIOs.},

  abstract  = {OBJECTIVE. MR imaging of central nervous system (CNS)
               malignancies falls short of a definitive evaluation. Tissue
               diagnosis remains the gold standard. Diffusion-tensor MR
               imaging measures the apparent diffusion coefficient and
               diffusion anisotropy of water in tissue. The purpose of
               this study was to test the hypothesis that the apparent
               diffusion coefficient may improve the MR imaging evaluation
               of newly diagnosed CNS neoplasms. We examined the
               relationship between the apparent diffusion coefficient,
               anisotropy, and tumor cellularity in 12 pediatric
               patients.MATERIALS AND METHODS. On the basis of
               histopathologic evaluation, tumors in this case series were
               segregated into three types: low-grade gliomas, embryonal
               tumors, and nonembryonal high-grade tumors. Mean apparent
               diffusion coefficient and anisotropy values obtained from
               the solid components of each tumor were compared with
               cellularity, total cellular area, and total nuclear area
               derived from biopsy material.RESULTS. The apparent
               diffusion coefficient ratio (tumor to normal brain)
               correlated well with tumor classification (p = 0.001).
               Anisotropy was decreased similarly in all tumor
               classifications. The absolute apparent diffusion
               coefficient correlated well with cellularity (p = 0.014)
               and total nuclear area (p = 0.005) per high-power field.
               The correlation between apparent diffusion coefficient and
               total cellular area per high-power field was not
               statistically significant.CONCLUSION. The apparent
               diffusion coefficient may be predictive of tumor
               classification and may be a useful tool in characterizing
               tumor cellularity and total nuclear area. These parameters
               are not available in standard MR imaging. Therefore,
               diffusion-tensor imaging may enhance the diagnostic process
               in pediatric CNS malignancies.},

              construction is made very fast while reliably avoiding the

              microstructural components, namely axonal fibers,
              oligodendrocytes and astrocytes. The algorithm reaches high
              values of packing density and angular dispersion for the
              axonal fibers, even in the case of multiple white matter
              fiber populations and enables the construction of complex
              biomimicking geometries including myelinated axons, beaded
              axons, and glial cells. The method can be readily adapted

  abstract  = { Parallel imaging is a recently developed family of
               techniques that take advantage of the spatial information
               inherent in phased-array radiofrequency coils to reduce
               acquisition times in magnetic resonance imaging. In
               parallel imaging, the number of sampled k-space lines is
               reduced, often by a factor of two or greater, thereby
               significantly shortening the acquisition time. Parallel
               imaging techniques have only recently become commercially
               available, and the wide range of clinical applications is
               just beginning to be explored. The potential clinical
               applications primarily involve reduction in acquisition
               time, improved spatial resolution, or a combination of the
               two. Improvements in image quality can be achieved by
               reducing the echo train lengths of fast spin-echo and
               single-shot fast spin-echo sequences. Parallel imaging is
               particularly attractive for cardiac and vascular
               applications and will likely prove valuable as 3-T body and
               cardiovascular imaging becomes part of standard clinical
               practice. Limitations of parallel imaging include reduced
               signal-to-noise ratio and reconstruction artifacts. It is
               important to consider these limitations when deciding when
               to use these techniques. © RSNA, 2005 },

  abstract  = {Article abstractâ€”Elevated iron levels in the
               substantia nigra (SN) of the brain in Parkinson's disease
               (PD) may mediate lipid peroxidative reactions, promoting SN
               neuronal death. To assess SN iron accumulation in living PD
               patients and its relation to motor performance, we
               measured, in 13 nondemented PD patients and 10 normal
               control subjects, simple reaction time (SRT) and simple
               movement time (SMT), followed by head MRI in a 3-tesla
               system. We measured T2 and T2* in the right and left SN of
               all subjects and calculated R2â€˜, the relaxation rate
               due to local magnetic field in-homogeneities, from these
               values. Asymmetries of 1/T2 (R2), l/T2* (R2*), or
               R2â€™ versus asymmetries of SRT and SMT were assessed
               in eight PD subjects who had not taken anti-PD
               medication(s1 for 12 hours. The average of right and lef
               Ïµ SN values for R2 was lower, and R2* and R2â€˜ were
               higher, in PD patients than in controls (R2, p = 0.046;
               R2*, p = 0.001; R2â€™, p < 0.001). R2â€˜ best
               predicted group differences. The asymmetry of SRT
               performance was highly correlated with asymmetries of SN
               R2* (0.91; p = 0.001) and R2â€™ (0.72; p = 0.03).
               These results strongly suggest that the increases in iron
               levels seen postmortem in the SN in PD are reflected in

  abstract  = {Restricted diffusion is a common feature of many
               physicochemical, biological, and industrial processes.
               Nuclear magnetic resonance techniques are often used to
               survey the atomic or molecular motion in confining media by
               applying inhomogeneous magnetic fields to encode the
               trajectories of spin-bearing particles. The diversity and
               complexity of diffusive NMR phenomena, observed in
               experiments, result from the specific properties of
               reflected Brownian motion. Here the focus is on the
               mathematical aspects of this stochastic process, their
               physical interpretations, and their practical applications.
               The main achievements in this field, from Hahnâ€™s
               discovery of spin echoes to present-day research, are
               presented in a unified mathematical language. A
               long-standing problem of restricted diffusion under
               arbitrary magnetic field is reformulated in terms of
               multiple correlation functions of the reflected Brownian
               motion. Many classical results are retrieved, extended, and
               critically discussed.},

@article{grebenkov2008,
  abstract  = {A geometrical confinement considerably affects the
               diffusive motion of the nuclei and the consequent signal
               attenuation under inhomogeneous magnetic fields. In this
               article, we illustrate the use of Laplacian eigenfunctions
               to describe this effect. Starting from the classical
               Bloch-Torrey equation, we obtain the free induction decay
               (FID) and the spin-echo or gradient-echo signal in a
               compact matrix form. Each attenuation mechanism (restricted
               diffusion, gradient dephasing, surface or bulk relaxation)
               is represented by a matrix which is constructed from the
               Laplace operator eigenbasis and thus depending only on the
               geometry of the confinement. In turn, the physical
               parameters (free diffusion coefficient, gradient intensity,
               surface or bulk relaxivity) characterize the
               ldquostrengthsrdquo of the underlying attenuation
               mechanisms and naturally appear as coefficients in front of
               these matrices. Once the Laplacian eigenfunctions for a
               given confinement are found (analytically or numerically),
               further computation of the macroscopic signal is more
               accurate and much faster than by using conventional
               simulation methods. The matrix technique is actually a
               simple numerical tool to deal with arbitrary gradient
               waveforms, including simple or stimulated, single or
               multiple spin echoes. We illustrate its efficiency by
               considering restricted diffusion in simple domains: a slab,
               a cylinder, and a sphere. In a companion paper, we shall
               focus on theoretical advances achieved by using Laplacian
               eigenfunctions. Â© 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Concepts

               platform for magnetic resonance (MR)-based investigation of
               sub-millimetre samples. The platform combines the
               advantages offered respectively by microcoils (high
               resolution at the microscale) and macroscopic surface coils
               (large field of view) as MR-detectors and consists of a
               phased array of microcoils (PAMs) providing a flat
               MR-sensitive area of 18.3 mm2 with a B0-field uniformity
               better than 0.25 ppm in the sensor centre area. We
               demonstrate both high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging
               (MRI) and NMR spectroscopy using this platform. To
               demonstrate the application for biological samples{,} we
               report MR imaging of fish oocytes with an in-plane
               resolution of 30 [times] 30 [small mu ]m2 and a contrast to
               noise ratio of 10 for a scan time of only 13 min 39 s. We
               have also demonstrated high-resolution spectroscopy of a
               water phantom achieving 11 ppb (4.5 Hz at 400 MHz)
               linewidth and an SNR of 28 for only 12 s scan time. State
               of the art automatic wire bonding technology in conjunction
               with MEMS techniques has been employed to manufacture the
               platform with potential applications in MR-investigation of
               planar samples.},

  abstract  = {The reduction of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC)
               of water shortly after a focal ischemic insult is thought
               to reflect intracellular water accumulation (cytotoxic
               edema) related to high-energy metabolism failure and loss
               of ion homeostasis. We attempted to clarify whether varying
               ranges of ADC measurements in ischemic brain tissue can be
               used to differentiate between reversible and irreversible
               ischemic lesions before reperfusion in a temporary ischemia
               model. We induced 45 minutes of temporary ischemia in 12
               rats using the middle cerebral artery suture occlusion
               method. Regional changes of ADC values were serially
               measured in seven regions of interest in each hemisphere
               and evaluated by Î”ADC, defined as the difference
               between ADC value in an ischemic region and that in a
               contralateral homologous region. We acquired dynamic
               contrast-enhanced perfusion images 2 minutes before and
               after reperfusion to document reduced perfusion and its
               restoration. We confirmed the infarct area by
               2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining 24 hours after
               occlusion and correlated this with the MRI studies.
               Recovery of initially reduced ADC values occurred only in
               ischemic regions where Î”ADC values were not below
               âˆ’0.25 Ã— 10âˆ’5 cm2/sec. Although the extent
               of infarction at postmortem examination varied in regions
               with moderately decreased prereperfusion ADC values, more
               than 70% of regions of interest with slight declines of
               prereperfusion ADC values exhibited no infarction. ADC
               values progressively decreased after reperfusion in regions
               that initially had severely decreased prereperfusion ADC
               values, and postmortem examination always demonstrated
               infarction in such regions. These results suggest that
               measurement of Î”ADC can provide information that will
               enable the clinician to discriminate between irreversible
               and potentially reversible ischemic regions before
               reperfusion is performed.},

  abstract = {Purpose Microscopic fractional anisotropy (µFA) can
              disentangle microstructural information from orientation
              dispersion. While double diffusion encoding (DDE) MRI
              methods are widely used to extract accurate µFA, it has
              only recently been proposed that powder-averaged single
              diffusion encoding (SDE) signals, when coupled with the
              diffusion standard model (SM) and a set of constraints,
              could be used for µFA estimation. This study aims to
              evaluate µFA as derived from the spherical mean technique
              (SMT) set of constraints, as well as more generally for
              powder-averaged SM signals. Methods SDE experiments were
              performed at 16.4 T on an ex vivo mouse brain (Δ/δ =
              12/1.5 ms). The µFA maps obtained from powder-averaged SDE
              signals were then compared to maps obtained from DDE-MRI
              experiments (Δ/τ/δ = 12/12/1.5 ms), which allow a
              model-free estimation of µFA. Theory and simulations that
              consider different types of heterogeneity are presented for
              corroborating the experimental findings. Results µFA, as
              well as other estimates derived from powder-averaged SDE
              signals produced large deviations from the ground truth in
              both gray and white matter. Simulations revealed that these
              misestimations are likely a consequence of factors not
              considered by the underlying microstructural models (such
              as intercomponent and intracompartmental kurtosis).
              Conclusion Powder-averaged SMT and (2-component) SM are
              unable to accurately report µFA and other microstructural
              parameters in ex vivo tissues. Improper model assumptions
              and constraints can significantly compromise parameter
              specificity. Further developments and validations are
              required prior to implementation of these models in
              clinical or preclinical research.},

@article{hollingsworth2015,
  abstract  = {MRI is often the most sensitive or appropriate technique
               for important measurements in clinical diagnosis and
               research, but lengthy acquisition times limit its use due
               to cost and considerations of patient comfort and
               compliance. Once an image field of view and resolution is
               chosen, the minimum scan acquisition time is normally fixed
               by the amount of raw data that must be acquired to meet the
               Nyquist criteria. Recently, there has been research
               interest in using the theory of compressed sensing (CS) in
               MR imaging to reduce scan acquisition times. The theory
               argues that if our target MR image is sparse, having signal
               information in only a small proportion of pixels (like an
               angiogram), or if the image can be mathematically
               transformed to be sparse then it is possible to use that
               sparsity to recover a high definition image from
               substantially less acquired data. This review starts by
               considering methods of k -space undersampling which have
               already been incorporated into routine clinical imaging
               (partial Fourier imaging and parallel imaging), and then
               explains the basis of using compressed sensing in MRI. The
               practical considerations of applying CS to MRI acquisitions
               are discussed, such as designing k -space undersampling
               schemes, optimizing adjustable parameters in
               reconstructions and exploiting the power of combined
               compressed sensing and parallel imaging (CS-PI). A
               selection of clinical applications that have used CS and
               CS-PI prospectively are considered. The review concludes by
               signposting other imaging acceleration techniques under
               present development before concluding with a consideration
               of the potential impact and obstacles to bringing
               compressed sensing into routine use in clinical MRI.},

  abstract  = {Introduction: The purpose of this study was to explore the
               potential of non-Gaussian diffusion and perfusion magnetic
               resonance imaging (MRI) using intravoxel incoherent motion
               (IVIM) MRI for the diagnosis of breast lesions.
               
               Methods: This study included 26 women with breast lesions.
               Diffusion-weighted images were acquired using 16 b values
               up to 2500 s/mm2 and analyzed using a kurtosis diffusion
               model (apparent diffusion coefficient [ADC0] and kurtosis
               [K]) for the diffusion component and IVIM model (perfusion
               fraction [fIVIM] and pseudodiffusion coefficient [D*]) for
               the perfusion component. Diagnostic performance of
               diffusion and perfusion parameters was evaluated from
               receiver operating characteristic analyses.
               
               Results: The ADC0 in malignant lesions was significantly
               lower than that in benign lesions and normal tissue (P <
               0.001, P < 0.001), whereas K was significantly higher (P <
               0.05, P < 0.001), as well as fIVIM (P < 0.05, P < 0.01). No
               significant difference was found in D*. The receiver
               operating characteristic analysis gave high area under the
               curve values for ADC0, K, and fIVIM for distinguishing
               malignant from benign lesions (0.99, 0.85, and 0.82,
               respectively). The ADC0 allowed benign tumors to be
               identified with 100% negative predictive value and
               malignant tumors with 100% sensitivity. The
               malignant/benign diagnosis thresholds were 1.4 x 10-3 mm2/s
               as well as 0.6 and 7%, respectively, for ADC0, K, and
               fIVIM.
               
               Conclusions: With a proper methodological framework, IVIM
               MRI can provide valuable information on tissue structure
               and microvasculature beneficial for the diagnosis of breast
               cancer lesions.

  abstract  = { MRI is one of the most dynamic and safe imaging
               techniques available in the clinic today. However, MRI
               acquisitions tend to be slow, limiting patient throughput
               and limiting potential indications for use while driving up
               costs. Compressed sensing (CS) is a method for accelerating
               MRI acquisition by acquiring less data through
               undersampling of k-space. This has the potential to
               mitigate the time-intensiveness of MRI. The limited body of
               research evaluating the effects of CS on MR images has been
               mostly positive with regards to its potential as a clinical
               tool. Studies have successfully accelerated MRI with this
               technology, with varying degrees of success. However, more
               must be performed before its diagnostic efficacy and
               benefits are clear. Studies involving a greater number
               radiologists and images must be completed, rating CS based
               on its diagnostic efficacy. Also, standardized methods for
               determining optimal imaging parameters must be developed.

  abstract  = {Abstract Exploring the pathways of manganese (Mn2&#xa0;+)
               transport in the nervous system becomes of interest as many
               recent studies use Mn2&#xa0;+ as a neural tract tracer in
               mammals. In this study, we performed manganese enhanced
               \{MRI\} (MEMRI) at 17.2&#xa0;T on the buccal ganglia of
               Aplysia californica. The main advantage of this model over
               mammalian systems is that it contains networks of large
               identified neurons. Using Mn2&#xa0;+ retrograde transport
               along selected nerves, we first validated the mapping of
               motor neurons’ axonal projections into peripheral nerves,
               previously obtained from optical imaging (Morton et al.,
               1991). This protocol was found not to alter the functional
               properties of the neuronal network. Second, we compared the
               Mn2&#xa0;+ dynamics inside the ganglia in the presence or
               absence of chemical stimulation. We found that 2&#xa0;h of
               stimulation with the modulatory transmitter dopamine
               increased the extent of areas of intermediate signal
               enhancement caused by manganese accumulation. In the
               absence of dopamine, an overall decrease of the enhanced
               areas in favor of non-enhanced areas was found, as a result
               of natural Mn2&#xa0;+ washout. This supports the hypothesis
               that, upon activation, Mn2&#xa0;+ is released from labeled
               neurons and captured by other, initially unlabeled,
               neurons. However, the latter could not be clearly
               identified due to lack of sensitivity and multiplicity of
               possible pathways starting from labeled cells. Nonetheless,
               the Aplysia buccal ganglia remain a well-suited model for
               attempting to visualize Mn2&#xa0;+ transport from neuron to
               neuron upon activation, as well as for studying
               dopaminergic modulation in a motor network. },

               characterized using two different models developed for
               limited clinical diffusion data: White Matter Tract
               Integrity (WMTI) metrics from Diffusional Kurtosis Imaging
               (DKI) and Neurite Orientation Dispersion and Density
               Imaging (NODDI). Both models reveal a non-linear increase
               in intra-axonal water fraction and in tortuosity of the

               expected behavior related to myelination and asynchrony of

               appreciably in normal brain development. The quantitative

  abstract  = {Abstract There is a need for accurate quantitative
               non-invasive biomarkers to monitor myelin pathology in vivo
               and distinguish myelin changes from other pathological
               features including inflammation and axonal loss.
               Conventional \{MRI\} metrics such as T2, magnetization
               transfer ratio and radial diffusivity have proven
               sensitivity but not specificity. In highly coherent white
               matter bundles, compartment-specific white matter tract
               integrity (WMTI) metrics can be directly derived from the
               diffusion and kurtosis tensors: axonal water fraction,
               intra-axonal diffusivity, and extra-axonal radial and axial
               diffusivities. We evaluate the potential of \{WMTI\} to
               quantify demyelination by monitoring the effects of both
               acute (6 weeks) and chronic (12 weeks) cuprizone
               intoxication and subsequent recovery in the mouse corpus
               callosum, and compare its performance with that of
               conventional metrics (T2, magnetization transfer, and
               \{DTI\} parameters). The changes observed in vivo
               correlated with those obtained from quantitative electron
               microscopy image analysis. A 6-week intoxication produced a
               significant decrease in axonal water fraction (p &lt;
               0.001), with only mild changes in extra-axonal radial
               diffusivity, consistent with patchy demyelination, while a
               12-week intoxication caused a more marked decrease in
               extra-axonal radial diffusivity (p = 0.0135), consistent
               with more severe demyelination and clearance of the
               extra-axonal space. Results thus revealed increased
               specificity of the axonal water fraction and extra-axonal
               radial diffusivity parameters to different degrees and
               patterns of demyelination. The specificities of these
               parameters were corroborated by their respective
               correlations with microstructural features: the axonal
               water fraction correlated significantly with the electron
               microscopy derived total axonal water fraction (ρ = 0.66;
               p = 0.0014) but not with the g-ratio, while the
               extra-axonal radial diffusivity correlated with the g-ratio
               (ρ = 0.48; p = 0.0342) but not with the electron
               microscopy derived axonal water fraction. These parameters
               represent promising candidates as clinically feasible
               biomarkers of demyelination and remyelination in the white
               matter. },

               features including inflammation and axonal loss.
               Conventional \{MRI\} metrics such as T2, magnetization
               transfer ratio and radial diffusivity have proven
               sensitivity but not specificity. In highly coherent white
               matter bundles, compartment-specific white matter tract
               integrity (WMTI) metrics can be directly derived from the
               diffusion and kurtosis tensors: axonal water fraction,
               intra-axonal diffusivity, and extra-axonal radial and axial
               diffusivities. We evaluate the potential of \{WMTI\} to
               quantify demyelination by monitoring the effects of both
               acute (6 weeks) and chronic (12 weeks) cuprizone
               intoxication and subsequent recovery in the mouse corpus
               callosum, and compare its performance with that of
               conventional metrics (T2, magnetization transfer, and
               \{DTI\} parameters). The changes observed in vivo
               correlated with those obtained from quantitative electron
               microscopy image analysis. A 6-week intoxication produced a
               significant decrease in axonal water fraction (p &lt;
               0.001), with only mild changes in extra-axonal radial
               diffusivity, consistent with patchy demyelination, while a
               12-week intoxication caused a more marked decrease in
               extra-axonal radial diffusivity (p = 0.0135), consistent
               with more severe demyelination and clearance of the
               extra-axonal space. Results thus revealed increased
               specificity of the axonal water fraction and extra-axonal
               radial diffusivity parameters to different degrees and
               patterns of demyelination. The specificities of these
               parameters were corroborated by their respective
               correlations with microstructural features: the axonal
               water fraction correlated significantly with the electron
               microscopy derived total axonal water fraction (ρ = 0.66;
               p = 0.0014) but not with the g-ratio, while the
               extra-axonal radial diffusivity correlated with the g-ratio
               (ρ = 0.48; p = 0.0342) but not with the electron
               microscopy derived axonal water fraction. These parameters
               represent promising candidates as clinically feasible
               biomarkers of demyelination and remyelination in the white
               matter. },

               science. With few exceptions, a more precise correspondence
               between physiological or biophysical properties and the
               obtained diffusion parameters remain uncertain due to lack
               of specificity. In this work, we address this problem by
               comparing diffusion parameters of a recently introduced
               model for water diffusion in brain matter to light
               microscopy and quantitative electron microscopy.
               Specifically, we compare diffusion model predictions of
               neurite density in rats to optical myelin staining
               intensity and stereological estimation of neurite volume

               electron microscopy, and thus reflect myelinated neurite
               density better than the more frequently used diffusion
               tensor imaging (DTI) and cumulant expansion methods.
               Furthermore, the estimated neurite orientations capture

               water diffusion anisotropy accompanies cellular

               is proposed here to relate water diffusion anisotropy

  abstract      = {Designing novel diffusion-weighted pulse sequences to probe tissue microstructure beyond the conventional Stejskal-Tanner family is currently of broad interest. One such technique, multidimensional diffusion MRI, has been recently proposed to afford model-free decomposition of diffusion signal kurtosis into terms originating from either ensemble variance of isotropic diffusivity or microscopic diffusion anisotropy. This ability rests on the assumption that diffusion can be described as a sum of multiple Gaussian compartments, but this is often not strictly fulfilled. The effects of nongaussian diffusion on single shot isotropic diffusion sequences were first considered in detail by de Swiet and Mitra in 1996. They showed theoretically that anisotropic compartments lead to anisotropic time dependence of the diffusion tensors, which causes the measured isotropic diffusivity to depend on gradient frame orientation. Here we show how such deviations from the multiple Gaussian compartments assumption conflates orientation dispersion with ensemble variance in isotropic diffusivity. Second, we consider additional contributions to the apparent variance in isotropic diffusivity arising due to intracompartmental kurtosis. These will likewise depend on gradient frame orientation. We illustrate the potential importance of these confounds with analytical expressions, numerical simulations in simple model geometries, and microimaging experiments in fixed spinal cord using isotropic diffusion encoding waveforms with 7.5 ms duration and 3000 mT/m maximum amplitude.},

  abstract  = {A simplified pore-to-pore hopping model for the two-phase
               diffusion problem is developed for the analysis of the
               pulsed gradient spin echo (PGSE) attenuation of water
               diffusion in the condensed cell suspension systems. In this
               model, the two phases inside and outside the cells are
               treated as two different kinds of pores, and the
               spin-bearing molecules perform hopping diffusion between
               them. The size and the orientations of those two respective
               pores are considered, and then the diffraction pattern of
               the PGSE attenuation may be well simulated. Nevertheless,
               the intensity of the characteristic peak decreases with
               increasing membrane permeability, from which the exchange
               time may be estimated. We then analyze the experimental 1H
               PGSE results of the erythrocytes suspension system. The
               water-residence lifetime in the erythrocyte is obtained to
               be 10 ms, which is the same as that estimated from the
               two-region approximation. Furthermore, the PGSE attenuation
               curve of addition of p-Chloromercuribenzenesulfonate
               (p-CMBS) is also discussed. It predicts that the alignment
               of erythrocytes will become normal to the magnetic field
               direction after the addition of p-CMBS, and inspection
               using a light microscope confirms that result.},

               imaging (MRI) can be simulated by means of an iterative
               solution of Bloch&#x2013;Torrey equations. This is a useful
               accessory to analyze the influence of sample properties,
               sequence parameters and hardware specifications on the MRI
               signal. In this paper, a computer algorithm is presented
               which is based on calculating partial derivatives of the
               magnetization vector. This technique allows more efficient
               simulation than summation of isochromats (the latter being
               commonly employed for this purpose) and, as a result, the
               effect of diffusion on the MRI signal can be calculated
               iteratively. A detailed description of the algorithm is
               given, and its feasibility for different applications is
               studied. It is shown that the algorithm is most applicable
               to simulating the effect of field perturbations, i.e.
               intra-voxel dephasing, but is also useful for other typical

  abstract  = {Abstract Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (d-MRI) is a
               powerful non-invasive and non-destructive technique for
               characterizing brain tissue on the microscopic scale.
               However, the lack of validation of d-MRI by independent
               experimental means poses an obstacle to accurate
               interpretation of data acquired using this method.
               Recently, structure tensor analysis has been applied to
               light microscopy images, and this technique holds promise
               to be a powerful validation strategy for d-MRI. Advantages
               of this approach include its similarity to d-MRI in terms
               of averaging the effects of a large number of cellular
               structures, and its simplicity, which enables it to be
               implemented in a high-throughput manner. However, a
               drawback of previous implementations of this technique
               arises from it being restricted to 2D. As a result,
               structure tensor analyses have been limited to tissue
               sectioned in a direction orthogonal to the direction of
               interest. Here we describe the analytical framework for
               extending structure tensor analysis to 3D, and utilize the
               results to analyze serial image “stacks” acquired with
               confocal microscopy of rhesus macaque hippocampal tissue.
               Implementation of 3D structure tensor procedures requires
               removal of sources of anisotropy introduced in tissue
               preparation and confocal imaging. This is accomplished with
               image processing steps to mitigate the effects of
               anisotropic tissue shrinkage, and the effects of anisotropy
               in the point spread function (PSF). In order to address the
               latter confound, we describe procedures for measuring the
               dependence of \{PSF\} anisotropy on distance from the
               microscope objective within tissue. Prior to microscopy, ex
               vivo d-MRI measurements performed on the hippocampal tissue
               revealed three regions of tissue with mutually orthogonal
               directions of least restricted diffusion that correspond to
               CA1, alveus and inferior longitudinal fasciculus. We
               demonstrate the ability of 3D structure tensor analysis to
               identify structure tensor orientations that are parallel to
               d-MRI derived diffusion tensors in each of these three
               regions. It is concluded that the 3D generalization of
               structure tensor analysis will further improve the utility
               of this method for validation of d-MRI by making it a more
               flexible experimental technique that closer resembles the
               inherently 3D nature of d-MRI measurements. },

               in magnetically heterogeneous samples affects the measured
               value of apparent diffusion coefficient. This effect is
               investigated theoretically in the context of diffusion
               measurements in perfused biological tissues with blood as
               the paramagnetic compartment. It is shown that the apparent
               diffusion coefficient is sensitive to mutual correlations
               in vessel positions. Neglect of these correlations results
               in a failure of the commonly used model of microvasculature
               in which vessels are described as independently placed
               cylinders. The model is modified to account for intervessel
               correlations. The results indicate an underestimation of
               apparent diffusion coefficient in proportion to the
               magnetic susceptibility of intravascular compartment in
               agreement with published experimental data. The
               proportionality coefficient depends on the microvascular
               architecture. Comparison with experimental data yields a

               measurements that probe white matter microstructure across
               a range of diffusion contrasts were sensitive to
               diagnosis-specific abnormalities in schizophrenia and
               independently predicted patient{\textendash}control
               differences in processing speed. Two orthogonal statistical
               factors extracted from DWI measurements explain most of
               diagnosis-related differences in processing speed.
               Moreover, DWI measurements explained a similar degree of
               variance in processing speed in patients and controls
               separately and in siblings of patients. This link remains
               contiguous across the diagnostic boundary and was not
               driven by subject selection or antipsychotic medication.
               The non-Gaussian diffusion white matter metrics are
               promising surrogate imaging markers for modeling cognitive
               deficits and perhaps, guiding treatment
               development.Schizophrenia, a devastating psychiatric
               illness with onset in the late teens to early 20s, is
               thought to involve disrupted brain connectivity. Functional
               and structural disconnections of cortical networks may
               underlie various cognitive deficits, including a
               substantial reduction in the speed of information
               processing in schizophrenia patients compared with
               controls. Myelinated white matter supports the speed of
               electrical signal transmission in the brain. To examine
               possible neuroanatomical sources of cognitive deficits, we
               used a comprehensive diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI)
               protocol and characterized the white matter diffusion
               signals using diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) and
               permeability{\textendash}diffusivity imaging (PDI) in
               patients (n = 74), their nonill siblings (n = 41), and
               healthy controls (n = 113). Diffusion parameters that
               showed significant patient{\textendash}control differences
               also explained the patient{\textendash}control differences
               in processing speed. This association was also found for
               the nonill siblings of the patients. The association was
               specific to processing-speed abnormality but not specific
               to working memory abnormality or psychiatric symptoms. Our
               findings show that advanced diffusion MRI in white matter
               may capture microstructural connectivity patterns and
               mechanisms that govern the association between a core
               neurocognitive measure{\textemdash}processing
               speed{\textemdash}and neurobiological deficits in
               schizophrenia that are detectable with in vivo brain scans.

               to obtain completely noninvasive tomographic maps of human
               brain activity, by using visual and motor stimulus
               paradigms. Changes in blood oxygenation were detected by
               using a gradient echo (GE) imaging sequence sensitive to
               the paramagnetic state of deoxygenated hemoglobin. Blood
               flow changes were evaluated by a spin-echo inversion
               recovery (IR), tissue relaxation parameter T1-sensitive
               pulse sequence. A series of images were acquired
               continuously with the same imaging pulse sequence (either
               GE or IR) during task activation. Cine display of
               subtraction images (activated minus baseline) directly
               demonstrates activity-induced changes in brain MR signal
               observed at a temporal resolution of seconds. During 8-Hz
               patterned-flash photic stimulation, a significant increase
               in signal intensity (paired t test; P less than 0.001) of
               1.8% +/- 0.8% (GE) and 1.8% +/- 0.9% (IR) was observed in
               the primary visual cortex (V1) of seven normal volunteers.
               The mean rise-time constant of the signal change was 4.4
               +/- 2.2 s for the GE images and 8.9 +/- 2.8 s for the IR
               images. The stimulation frequency dependence of visual
               activation agrees with previous positron emission
               tomography observations, with the largest MR signal
               response occurring at 8 Hz. Similar signal changes were
               observed within the human primary motor cortex (M1) during
               a hand squeezing task and in animal models of increased
               blood flow by hypercapnia. By using intrinsic blood-tissue
               contrast, functional MRI opens a spatial-temporal window
               onto individual brain physiology.},

               to study the effects of restricted diffusion in a
               biological phantom consisting of green asparagus stems
               using q-space MRI at a clinical scanner.
               Method&nbsp;&nbsp;Measurements of the full width at half
               maximum (FWHM) of the displacement distribution were
               performed with varied diffusion time (T d). The accuracy of
               the measurements was investigated with respect to the
               degree of violation of the short gradient pulse (SGP)
               condition, partial volume effects and a FWHM-based tensor
               model. Results&nbsp;&nbsp;The measurements showed a
               reasonably constant FWHM perpendicular to the capillaries
               in the vascular bundles and an increased FWHM parallel with
               the bundles when the T d was increased. A 15% decrease in
               FWHM perpendicular to the bundles was observed when the
               diffusion encoding duration was prolonged from 24 to
               74&nbsp;ms, owing to the violation of the SGP condition.
               For a population of different confinement sizes,
               simulations indicated that the FWHM reflects the smaller
               sizes rather then the mean size of the confinements.
               Conclusion&nbsp;&nbsp;A new method allowing tensor analysis
               of FWHM was derived and yielded accurate results. In
               conclusion, we found it possible to measure the effects of
               restricted diffusion with q-space MRI using a clinical MRI

  abstract      = {In diffusion MRI (dMRI), microscopic diffusion anisotropy can be obscured by orientation dispersion. Separation of these properties is of high importance, since it could allow dMRI to non-invasively probe elongated structures such as neurites (axons and dendrites). However, conventional dMRI, based on single diffusion encoding (SDE), entangles microscopic anisotropy and orientation dispersion with intra-voxel variance in isotropic diffusivity. SDE-based methods for estimating microscopic anisotropy, such as the neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) method, must thus rely on model assumptions to disentangle these features. An alternative approach is to directly quantify microscopic anisotropy by the use of variable shape of the b-tensor. Along those lines, we here present the ‘constrained diffusional variance decomposition’ (CODIVIDE) method, which jointly analyzes data acquired with diffusion encoding applied in a single direction at a time (linear tensor encoding, LTE) and in all directions (spherical tensor encoding, STE). We then contrast the two approaches by comparing neurite density estimated using NODDI with microscopic anisotropy estimated using CODIVIDE. Data were acquired in healthy volunteers and in glioma patients. NODDI and CODIVIDE differed the most in gray matter and in gliomas, where NODDI detected a neurite fraction higher than expected from the level of microscopic diffusion anisotropy found with CODIVIDE. The discrepancies could be explained by the NODDI tortuosity assumption, which enforces a connection between the neurite density and the mean diffusivity of tissue. Our results suggest that this assumption is invalid, which leads to a NODDI neurite density that is inconsistent between LTE and STE data. Using simulations, we demonstrate that the NODDI assumptions result in parameter bias that precludes the use of NODDI to map neurite density. With CODIVIDE, we found high levels of microscopic anisotropy in white matter, intermediate levels in structures such as the thalamus and the putamen, and low levels in the cortex and in gliomas. We conclude that accurate mapping of microscopic anisotropy requires data acquired with variable shape of the b-tensor.},

  abstract = {Abstract In vivo mapping of the neurite density with
              diffusion MRI (dMRI) is a high but challenging aim. First,
              it is unknown whether all neurites exhibit completely
              anisotropic (“stick-like”) diffusion. Second, the
              “density” of tissue components may be confounded by
              non-diffusion properties such as T2 relaxation. Third, the
              domain of validity for the estimated parameters to serve as
              indices of neurite density is incompletely explored. We
              investigated these challenges by acquiring data with
              “b-tensor encoding” and multiple echo times in brain
              regions with low orientation coherence and in white matter
              lesions. Results showed that microscopic anisotropy from
              b-tensor data is associated with myelinated axons but not
              with dendrites. Furthermore, b-tensor data together with
              data acquired for multiple echo times showed that unbiased
              density estimates in white matter lesions require
              data-driven estimates of compartment-specific T2 values.
              Finally, the “stick” fractions of different biophysical
              models could generally not serve as neurite density indices
              across the healthy brain and white matter lesions, where
              outcomes of comparisons depended on the choice of
              constraints. In particular, constraining
              compartment-specific T2 values was ambiguous in the healthy
              brain and had a large impact on estimated values. In
              summary, estimating neurite density generally requires
              accounting for different diffusion and/or T2 properties
              between axons and dendrites. Constrained “index”
              parameters could be valid within limited domains that
              should be delineated by future studies.},

               boundary layer, while keeping fine mesh for the diffusive
               interface. For isothermal cases, our calculated results

               voxel in the presence of magnetic field gradients. This
               distribution produces a spin-echo attenuation. The authors
               have developed a magnetic resonance (MR) method to image
               such intravoxel incoherent motions (IVIMs) by using
               appropriate gradient pulses. Images were generated at 0.5 T
               in a high-resolution, multisection mode. Diffusion
               coefficients measured on images of water and acetone
               phantoms were consistent with published values. Images
               obtained in the neurologic area from healthy subjects and
               patients were analyzed in terms of an apparent diffusion
               coefficient (ADC) incorporating the effect of all IVIMs.
               Differences were found between various normal and
               pathologic tissues. The ADC of in vivo water differed from
               the diffusion coefficient of pure water. Results were
               assessed in relation to water compartmentation in biologic
               tissues (restricted diffusion) and tissue perfusion.
               Nonuniform slow flow of cerebrospinal fluid appeared as a
               useful feature on IVIM images. Observation of these motions
               may significantly extend the diagnostic capabilities of MR

  abstract  = {Intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) imaging is a method
               the authors developed to visualize microscopic motions of
               water. In biologic tissues, these motions include molecular
               diffusion and microcirculation of blood in the capillary
               network. IVIM images are quantified by an apparent
               diffusion coefficient (ADC), which integrates the effects
               of both diffusion and perfusion. The aim of this work was
               to demonstrate how much perfusion contributes to the ADC
               and to present a method for obtaining separate images of
               diffusion and perfusion. Images were obtained at 0.5 T with
               high-resolution multisection sequences and without the use
               of contrast material. Results in a phantom made of resin
               microspheres demonstrated the ability of the method to
               separately evaluate diffusion and perfusion. The method was
               then applied in patients with brain and bone tumors and
               brain ischemia. Clinical results showed significant promise
               of the method for tissue characterization by perfusion

               the microcirculation in physiologic and pathologic

               The time course of this water phase transition preceded the

  abstract  = {Functional neuroimaging has emerged as an important
               approach to study the brain and the mind. Surprisingly,
               although they are based on radically different physical
               approaches both positron emission tomography (PET) and
               magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) make brain activation
               imaging possible through measurements involving water
               molecules. So far, PET and MRI functional imaging have
               relied on the principle that neuronal activation and blood
               flow are coupled through metabolism. However, a new
               paradigm has emerged to look at brain activity through the
               observation with MRI of the molecular diffusion of water.
               In contrast with the former approaches diffusion MRI has
               the potential to reveal changes in the intrinsic water
               physical properties during brain activation, which could be
               more intimately linked to the neuronal activation
               mechanisms and lead to an improved spatial and temporal
               resolution. However, this link has yet to be fully
               confirmed and understood. To shed light on the possible
               relationship between water and brain activation, this
               introductory paper reviews the most recent data on the
               physical properties of water and on the status of water in
               biological tissues, and evaluates their relevance to brain
               diffusion MRI. The biophysical mechanisms of brain
               activation are then reassessed to reveal their intimacy
               with the physical properties of water, which may come to be
               regarded as the 'molecule of the mind'.},

               schemes first proposed in [1] for solving the wave equation
               in complex geometry using an embedded Cartesian grid. These
               schemes rely on an integral evolution formula for which the
               numerical domain of dependence adjusts automatically to
               contain the true domain of dependence. Here, we refine and
               analyze a subclass of such schemes, which satisfy a
               condition we refer to as strong u-consistency. This
               requires that the evolution scheme be exact for a
               single-valued approximation to the solution at the previous
               time steps. We provide evidence that many of these strongly
               u-consistent schemes are stable and converge at very high
               order even in the presence of small cells in the grid,
               while taking time steps dictated by the uniform grid

               imaging modality that probes the diffusion characteristics
               of a sample via the application of magnetic field gradient
               pulses. The dMRI signal from a heterogeneous sample
               includes the contribution of the water proton magnetization
               from all spatial positions in a voxel. If the voxel can be
               spatially divided into different Gaussian diffusion
               compartments with inter-compartment exchange governed by
               linear kinetics, then the dMRI signal can be approximated
               using the macroscopic Karger model, which is a system of
               coupled ordinary differential equations (ODEs), under the
               assumption that the duration of the diffusion-encoding
               gradient pulses is short compared to the diffusion time
               (the narrow pulse assumption). Recently, a new macroscopic
               model of the dMRI signal, without the narrow pulse
               restriction, was derived from the Blochâ€“Torrey
               partial differential equation (PDE) using periodic
               homogenization techniques. When restricted to narrow
               pulses, this new homogenized model has the same form as the
               Karger model.},

  abstract = {The complex transverse water proton magnetization subject to diffusion-encoding magnetic field gradient pulses in a heterogeneous medium can be modeled by the multiple compartment Bloch-Torrey partial differential equation. Under the assumption of negligible water exchange between compartments, the time-dependent apparent diffusion coefficient can be directly computed from the solution of a diffusion equation subject to a time-dependent Neumann boundary condition. This paper describes a publicly available MATLAB toolbox called SpinDoctor that can be used 1) to solve the Bloch-Torrey partial differential equation in order to simulate the diffusion magnetic resonance imaging signal; 2) to solve a diffusion partial differential equation to obtain directly the apparent diffusion coefficient; 3) to compare the simulated apparent diffusion coefficient with a short-time approximation formula. The partial differential equations are solved by P1 finite elements combined with built-in MATLAB routines for solving ordinary differential equations. The finite element mesh generation is performed using an external package called Tetgen. SpinDoctor provides built-in options of including 1) spherical cells with a nucleus; 2) cylindrical cells with a myelin layer; 3) an extra-cellular space enclosed either a) in a box or b) in a tight wrapping around the cells; 4) deformation of canonical cells by bending and twisting; 5) permeable membranes; Built-in diffusion-encoding pulse sequences include the Pulsed Gradient Spin Echo and the Oscillating Gradient Spin Echo. We describe in detail how to use the SpinDoctor toolbox. We validate SpinDoctor simulations using reference signals computed by the Matrix Formalism method. We compare the accuracy and computational time of SpinDoctor simulations with Monte-Carlo simulations and show significant speed-up of SpinDoctor over Monte-Carlo simulations in complex geometries. We also illustrate several extensions of SpinDoctor functionalities, including the incorporation of T2 relaxation, the simulation of non-standard diffusion-encoding sequences, as well as the use of externally generated geometrical meshes.},

  abstract  = {The objective of this paper is to use Biot's theory and
               the Johnson-Koplik-Dashen dynamic permeability model in
               wave field simulation of a heterogeneous porous medium. The
               Johnson-Koplik-Dashen dynamic permeability model was
               originally formulated in the frequency domain. In this
               paper, the time domain drag force expression of the model
               is expressed in terms of the shifted fractional derivative
               of the relative fluid velocity. In contrast to the
               exponential-type viscous relaxation models, the convolution
               operator in the Johnson-Koplik-Dashen dynamic permeability
               model cannot be replaced by memory variables satisfying
               first-order relaxation differential equations. A new method
               for calculating the shifted fractional derivative without
               storing and integrating the entire velocity histories is
               developed. Using the new method to calculate the fractional
               derivative, the governing equations for the two-dimensional
               porous medium are reduced to a system of first-order
               differential equations for velocities, stresses, pore
               pressure and the quadrature variables associated with the
               drag forces. Spatial derivatives involved in the
               first-order differential equations system are calculated by
               Fourier pseudospectral method, while the time derivative of
               the system is discretized by a predictor-corrector method.
               For the demonstration of our method, some numerical results
               are presented.},

  abstract  = {The study of reactionâ€“diffusion processes is much
               more complicated on general curved surfaces than on
               standard Cartesian coordinate spaces. Here we show how to
               formulate and solve systems of reactionâ€“diffusion
               equations on surfaces in an extremely simple way, using
               only the standard Cartesian form of differential operators,
               and a discrete unorganized point set to represent the
               surface. Our method decouples surface geometry from the
               underlying differential operators. As a consequence, it
               becomes possible to formulate and solve rather general
               reactionâ€“diffusion equations on general surfaces
               without having to consider the complexities of differential
               geometry or sophisticated numerical analysis. To illustrate
               the generality of the method, computations for surface
               diffusion, pattern formation, excitable media, and
               bulk-surface coupling are provided for a variety of complex
               point cloud surfaces.},

@article{malmborg2006,
  abstract  = {Finite gradient pulse lengths are traditionally considered
               a nuisance in q -space diffusion NMR and MRI, since the
               simple Fourier relation between the acquired signal and the
               displacement probability is invalidated. Increasing the
               value of the pulse length leads to an apparently smaller
               value of the estimated compartment size. We propose that q
               -space data at different gradient pulse lengths, but with
               the same effective diffusion time, can be used to identify
               and quantify components with free or restricted diffusion
               from multiexponential echo decay curves obtained on
               cellular systems. The method is demonstrated with
               experiments on excised human brain white matter and a
               series of model systems with well-defined free, restricted,
               and combined free and restricted diffusion behavior.
               Time-resolved diffusion MRI experiments are used to map the
               spatial distribution of the intracellular fraction in a
               yeast cell suspension during sedimentation, and observe the
               disappearance of this fraction after a heat treatment.},

  abstract  = {This work presents preliminary results on the development,
               characterisation, and use of a novel physical phantom
               designed as a simple mimic of tumour cellular structure,
               for diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI)
               applications. The phantom consists of a collection of
               roughly spherical, micron-sized core--shell polymer
               `cells', providing a system whose ground truth
               microstructural properties can be determined and compared
               with those obtained from modelling the DW-MRI signal. A
               two-compartment analytic model combining restricted
               diffusion inside a sphere with hindered extracellular
               diffusion was initially investigated through Monte Carlo
               diffusion simulations, allowing a comparison between
               analytic and simulated signals. The model was then fitted
               to DW-MRI data acquired from the phantom over a range of
               gradient strengths and diffusion times, yielding estimates
               of `cell' size, intracellular volume fraction and the free
               diffusion coefficient. An initial assessment of the
               accuracy and precision of these estimates is provided,
               using independent scanning electron microscope measurements
               and bootstrap-style simulations. Such phantoms may be
               useful for testing microstructural models relevant to the
               characterisation of tumour tissue.},

  abstract  = {Interpretation of brain states from EEG single trials,
               multiple electrodes and time points, is addressed. A
               computationally efficient and robust framework for
               spatio-temporal feature selection is introduced. The
               framework is generic and can be applied to different
               classification tasks. Here, it is applied to a visual task
               of distinguishing between faces and houses. The framework
               includes training of regularized logistic regression
               classifier with cross-validation and the usage of a wrapper
               approach to find the optimal model. It was compared with
               two other methods for selection of time points. The
               spatial-temporal information of brain activity obtained
               using this framework, can give an indication to correlated
               activity of regions in the brain (spatial) as well as
               temporal activity correlations between and within EEG
               electrodes. This spatial-temporal analysis can render a far
               more holistic interpretability for visual perception
               mechanism without any a priori bias on certain time periods

               technique that can reveal unique information of white
               matter (WM) structures inside the central nervous system

               unique tissue contrasts that can be used in the study of
               axonal organization in the CNS. Its applications include
               brain connectivity, development, and \{WM\} diseases. This

               We adapt a mouse global ischemia model to permit rapid
               induction of ischemia and reperfusion in conjunction with
               two-photon imaging to monitor the initial ionic,
               structural, and functional implications of brief
               interruptions of blood flow (6â€“8 min) in vivo. After
               only 2â€“3 min of global ischemia, a wide spread loss
               of mouse somatosensory cortex apical dendritic structure is
               initiated during the passage of a propagating wave (3.3
               mm/min) of ischemic depolarization. Increases in
               intracellular calcium levels occurred during the wave of
               ischemic depolarization and were coincident with the loss
               of dendritic structure, but were not triggered by
               reperfusion. To assess the role of NMDA receptors, we
               locally applied the antagonist MK-801
               [(+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[a,d]cyclohepten-5,10-imine
               maleate] at concentrations sufficient to fully block local
               NMDA agonist-evoked changes in intracellular calcium levels
               in vivo. Changes in dendritic structure and intracellular
               calcium levels were independent of NMDA receptor
               activation. Local application of the non-NMDA glutamate
               receptor antagonist CNQX also failed to block ischemic
               depolarization or rapid changes in dendrite structure.
               Within 3â€“5 min of reperfusion, damage ceased and
               restoration of synaptic structure occurred over
               10â€“60 min. In contrast to a reperfusion promoting
               damage, over this time scale, the majority of spines and
               dendrites regained their original structure during
               reperfusion. Intrinsic optical signal imaging of sensory
               evoked maps indicated that reversible alteration in
               dendritic structure during reperfusion was accompanied by
               restored functional maps. Our results identify glutamate
               receptor-independent ischemic depolarization as the major
               ionic event associated with disruption of synaptic
               structure during the first few minutes of ischemia in
               vivo.},

  abstract  = {An anisotropic phase-field model is used to simulate
               numerically dendritic solidification for a pure material in
               two dimensions. The phase-field model has been formulated
               to include the effect of four-fold anisotropy in both the
               surface energy and interfacial kinetics. The computations
               presented here are intended to model qualitatively
               experimentally observed dendritic solidification
               morphology. In particular, we simulate the growth into an
               undercooled melt of two dendrite tips which have formed as
               the result of a splitting event. The computation exhibits
               the competition between the two growing dendrite branches
               and the eventual predominance of one branch. Also, we
               simulate the effect of time-periodic forcing of an isolated
               dendrite tip on the mechanism of sidebranch formation.
               Although it is not yet computationally feasible to
               adequately verify convergence of the phase-field solutions,
               the phase-field simulations presented show many of the
               qualitative features observed in dendritic growth
               experiments.},

              The integral of the solution of this PDE yields the
              diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) signal. In a
              complex medium such as cerebral tissue, it is difficult to
              explicitly link the dMRI signal to biological parameters
              such as the cellular geometry or the cellular volume
              fraction. Studying the dMRI signal arising from a single
              neuron can provide insight into how the geometrical
              structure of neurons influences the measured signal. We
              formulate the Bloch-Torrey PDE inside a single neuron,
              under no water exchange condition with the extracellular
              space, and show how to reduce the 3D simulation in the full
              neuron to a 3D simulation around the soma and 1D
              simulations in the neurites. We show that this latter
              approach is computationally much faster than full 3D
              simulation and still gives accurate results over a wide
              range of diffusion times.},

  abstract = {Abstract The complex transverse water proton magnetization
              subject to diffusion-encoding magnetic field gradient
              pulses in a heterogeneous medium can be modeled by the
              multiple compartment Bloch–Torrey partial differential
              equation (PDE). In addition, steady-state Laplace \{PDEs\}
              can be formulated to produce the homogenized diffusion
              tensor that describes the diffusion characteristics of the
              medium in the long time limit. In spatial domains that
              model biological tissues at the cellular level, these two
              types of \{PDEs\} have to be completed with permeability
              conditions on the cellular interfaces. To solve these PDEs,
              we implemented a finite elements method that allows jumps
              in the solution at the cell interfaces by using double
              nodes. Using a transformation of the Bloch–Torrey \{PDE\}
              we reduced oscillations in the searched-for solution and
              simplified the implementation of the boundary conditions.
              The spatial discretization was then coupled to the adaptive
              explicit Runge–Kutta–Chebyshev time-stepping method.
              Our proposed method is second order accurate in space and
              second order accurate in time. We implemented this method
              on the \{FEniCS\} C++ platform and show time and spatial
              convergence results. Finally, this method is applied to
              study some relevant questions in diffusion MRI. },

               tree structure can affect the diffusion magnetic resonance
               imaging (dMRI) signal in brain tissue. For a large set of
               randomly generated dendrite trees, synthetic dMRI signals
               are computed and fitted to a cylinder model to estimate the
               effective longitudinal diffusivity D L in the direction of
               neurites. When the dendrite branches are short compared to
               the diffusion length, D L depends significantly on the
               ratio between the average branch length and the diffusion
               length. In turn, D L has very weak dependence on the
               distribution of branch lengths and orientations of a
               dendrite tree, and the number of branches per node. We
               conclude that the cylinder model which ignores the
               connectivity of the dendrite tree, can still be adapted to
               describe the apparent diffusion coefficient in brain

               compressed sensing (CS) on a high field preclinical scanner
               (17.2 T) using an undersampling trajectory based on the

               When applied to a library of images this approach performs
               better than the traditional undersampling based on the
               polynomial probability density function. In addition, we
               show that the method is applicable to imaging live neuronal
               tissues, allowing significantly shorter acquisition times

               identifying the majority of neurons via an automatic cell

  abstract = {The extracellular space (ECS) consists of the narrow
              channels between brain cells together with their
              geometrical configuration and contents. Despite being only
              20--60 nm in width, the ECS typically occupies 20{\%} of
              the brain volume. Numerous experiments over the last 50
              years have established that molecules moving through the
              ECS obey the laws of diffusion but with an effective
              diffusion coefficient reduced by a factor of about 2.6
              compared to free diffusion. This review considers the
              origins of the diffusion barrier arising from the ECS and
              its properties. The paper presents a brief overview of
              software for implementing two point-source paradigms for
              measurements of localized diffusion properties: the
              real-time iontophoresis or pressure method for small ions
              and the integrative optical imaging method for
              macromolecules. Selected results are presented. This is
              followed by a discussion of the application of the MCell
              Monte Carlo simulation program to determining the
              importance of geometrical constraints, especially
              dead-space microdomains, and the possible role of
              interaction with the extracellular matrix. It is concluded
              that we can predict the impediment to diffusion of many
              molecules of practical importance and also use studies of
              the diffusion of selected molecular probes to reveal the
              barrier properties of the ECS.},

               diffusion on a cell membrane was used to investigate the
               fundamental causes of anomalous diffusion in
               two-dimensional biological media. Three different
               interactions were considered: collisions with fixed
               obstacles, picket fence posts, and capture by, or exclusion
               from, lipid rafts. If motion is impeded by randomly placed,
               fixed obstacles, we find that diffusion can be highly
               anomalous, in agreement with previous studies. In contrast,
               collision with picket fence posts has a negligible effect
               on the anomalous exponent at realistic picket fence
               parameters. The effects of lipid rafts are more complex. If
               proteins partition into lipid rafts there is a small to
               moderate effect on the anomalous exponent, whereas if
               proteins are excluded from rafts there is a large effect on
               the anomalous exponent. In combination, these mechanisms
               can explain the level of anomaly in experimentally observed
               membrane diffusion, suggesting that anomalous diffusion is
               caused by multiple mechanisms whose effects are
               approximately additive. Finally, we show that the
               long-range diffusion rate, Dmacro, estimated from
               fluorescence recovery after photobleaching studies, can be
               much smaller than Dmicro, the small-scale diffusion rate,
               and is highly sensitive to obstacle densities and other
               impeding structures. 10.1529/biophysj.105.076869},

               diffusive motion of molecules is a challenging problem in
               diffusion physics. In this paper, we introduce a novel
               representation of diffusion MRI (dMRI) signal from tissue
               with spatially-varying diffusivity using a diffusion
               disturbance function. This disturbance function contains
               information about the (intra-voxel) spatial fluctuations in
               diffusivity due to restrictions, hindrances and tissue
               heterogeneity of the underlying tissue substrate. We derive
               the short- and long-range disturbance coefficients from
               this disturbance function to characterize the tissue
               structure and organization. Moreover, we provide an exact
               relation between the disturbance coefficients and the
               time-varying moments of the diffusion propagator, as well
               as their relation to specific tissue microstructural
               information such as the intra-axonal volume fraction and
               the apparent axon radius. The proposed approach is quite
               general and can model dMRI signal for any type of gradient
               sequence (rectangular, oscillating, etc.) without using the
               Gaussian phase approximation. The relevance of the proposed
               PICASO model is explored using Monte-Carlo simulations and
               in-vivo dMRI data. The results show that the estimated
               disturbance coefficients can distinguish different types of
               microstructural organization of axons.},

              as a noninvasive window into tissue organization at the
              cellular level. Having originated within the realm of
              diffusion NMR in the late 1970s, this field is experiencing
              an exponential growth in the number of publications. At the
              same time, model-based approaches are also increasingly
              incorporated into advanced MRI acquisition and

              neuronal tissue, by putting them into an overarching
              physical context of coarse-graining over an increasing
              diffusion length scale. From this perspective, we view
              research on quantifying brain microstructure as occurring
              along three major avenues. The first avenue focusses on
              transient, or time-dependent, effects in diffusion. These
              effects signify the gradual coarse-graining of tissue
              structure, which occurs qualitatively differently in
              different brain tissue compartments. We show that transient
              effects contain information about the relevant length
              scales for neuronal tissue, such as the packing correlation
              length for neuronal fibers, as well as the degree of
              structural disorder along the neurites. The second avenue
              corresponds to the long-time limit, when the observed

              challenge lies in parameter estimation and in resolving its
              hidden degeneracies. The third avenue employs multiple
              diffusion encoding techniques, able to access information
              not contained in the conventional diffusion propagator. We

               Measurement of molecular diffusion performed at a
               macroscopic level is a common noninvasive structural probe.
               Interpreting its results involves identifying which
               structural features, out of a myriad of parameters, most
               strongly affect the diffusion coefficient. Here we address
               this ill-posed problem by classifying media into a
               relatively small number of universality classes, based on
               the nature of long-range structural correlations. We show
               that the time dependence of a macroscopic diffusion
               coefficient distinguishes between these classes. Using this
               approach, we identify dominant restrictions to MRI-measured

  abstract = {This report introduces a novel method to characterize the
              diffusion-time dependence of the diffusion-weighted
              magnetic resonance (MR) signal in biological tissues. The
              approach utilizes the theory of diffusion in disordered
              media where two parameters, the random walk dimension and
              the spectral dimension, describe the evolution of the
              average propagators obtained from q-space MR experiments.
              These parameters were estimated, using several schemes, on
              diffusion MR spectroscopy data obtained from human red
              blood cell ghosts and nervous tissue autopsy samples. The
              experiments demonstrated that water diffusion in human
              tissue is anomalous, where the mean-square displacements
              vary slower than linearly with diffusion time. These
              observations are consistent with a fractal microstructure
              for human tissues. Differences observed between healthy
              human nervous tissue and glioblastoma samples suggest that
              the proposed methodology may provide a novel, clinically
              useful form of diffusion MR contrast.},

  abstract  = {Delineating cortical microstructure differentiation is
               important for understanding complicated yet precisely
               organized patterns in early developing brain. Knowledge of
               cortical differentiation predominantly from histological
               studies is limited in localized and discrete cortical
               regions. We quantified the preterm brain cerebral cortical
               profile with microstructural complexity [indexed by mean
               kurtosis (MK)] and microstructural organization [indexed by
               fractional anisotropy (FA)] from advanced diffusion MRI.
               Cortical MK and FA maps revealed a heterogeneous maturation
               signature. Spatiotemporally distinctive disruption of
               radial glia and decrease of neuronal density among cortical
               regions were inferred by FA and MK decreases, respectively.
               These findings suggest that diffusion kurtosis metrics are
               significant imaging markers for microstructural
               differentiation of the developmental brain in health and
               disease.During the third trimester, the human brain
               undergoes rapid cellular and molecular processes that
               reshape the structural architecture of the cerebral cortex.
               Knowledge of cortical differentiation obtained
               predominantly from histological studies is limited in
               localized and small cortical regions. How cortical
               microstructure is differentiated across cortical regions in
               this critical period is unknown. In this study, the
               cortical microstructural architecture across the entire
               cortex was delineated with non-Gaussian diffusion kurtosis
               imaging as well as conventional diffusion tensor imaging of
               89 preterm neonates aged 31{\textendash}42 postmenstrual
               weeks. The temporal changes of cortical mean kurtosis (MK)
               or fractional anisotropy (FA) were heterogeneous across the
               cortical regions. Cortical MK decreases were observed
               throughout the studied age period, while cortical FA
               decrease reached its plateau around 37 weeks. More rapid
               decreases in MK were found in the primary visual region,
               while faster FA declines were observed in the prefrontal
               cortex. We found that distinctive cortical microstructural
               changes were coupled with microstructural maturation of
               associated white matter tracts. Both cortical MK and FA
               measurements predicted the postmenstrual age of preterm
               infants accurately. This study revealed a differential 4D
               spatiotemporal cytoarchitectural signature inferred by
               non-Gaussian diffusion barriers inside the cortical plate
               during the third trimester. The cytoarchitectural
               processes, including dendritic arborization and neuronal
               density decreases, were inferred by regional cortical FA
               and MK measurements. The presented findings suggest that
               cortical MK and FA measurements could be used as effective
               imaging markers for cortical microstructural changes in
               typical and potentially atypical brain development.},

               recently introduced a powerful formalism to represent the
               diffusion-attenuated NMR signal for simple pore geometries
               such as slabs, cylinders, and spheres analytically. In this
               work, we extend this multiple correlation function
               formalism by allowing for possible variations in the
               direction of the magnetic field gradient waveform. This
               extension is necessary, for example, to incorporate the
               effects of imaging gradients in diffusion-weighted NMR
               imaging scans and in characterizing anisotropy at different
               length scales via double pulsed field gradient (PFG)
               experiments. In cylindrical and spherical pores,
               respectively, two- and three-dimensional vector operators
               are employed whose form is deduced from Grebenkov's results
               via elementary operator algebra for the case of cylinders
               and the Wigner-Eckart theorem for the case of spheres. The

              been limited by their lack of realism and flexibility. The
              purpose of this work is to propose a controlled and
              flexible generative model for brain cell morphology and an
              efficient computational pipeline for the reliable and
              robust simulation of realistic cellular structures with
              application to numerical simulation of intra-cellular
              diffusion-weighted MR (DW-MR) signal features. Inspired by
              the advances in computational neuroscience for modelling
              brain cells, we propose a generative model that enables
              users to simulate molecular diffusion within realistic
              digital brain cells, such as neurons, in a completely
              controlled and flexible fashion. We validate our new
              approach by showing an excellent match between the
              morphology (no statistically different 3D Sholl metrics,
              P > 0.05) and simulated intra-cellular DW-MR signal
              (mean relative difference < 2%) of the generated
              digital model of brain cells and those of digital
              reconstruction of real brain cells from available
              open-access databases. We demonstrate the versatility and
              potential of the framework by showing a select set of
              examples of relevance for the DW-MR community. The
              computational models introduced here are useful for
              synthesizing intra-cellular DW-MR signals, similar to those
              one might measure from brain metabolites DW-MRS
              experiments. They also provide the foundation for a more
              complete simulation system that will potentially include
              signals from extra-cellular compartments and exchange
              processes, necessary for synthesizing DW-MR signals of

  abstract  = {Characterizing the microstructure of an organ
               noninvasively using molecular diffusion measurements
               represents a major challenge in medical imaging and life
               science. In this work, we propose concepts in diffusion
               magnetic resonance to noninvasively extract morphological
               properties of brain cells that are out of reach of existing
               neuroimaging techniques, such as diffusion-weighted MRI. We
               show how long-range morphology of neurons and astrocytes
               can affect the diffusion of cell-specific metabolites at
               ultra-long diffusion times and that adequate modeling
               strategy seems to allow extracting morphological parameters
               such as astrocytic and neuronal process length and
               complexity, opening the way to noninvasive histology of the
               brain. We believe that the concepts and methods introduced
               here may represent a significant breakthrough in
               neuroimaging and neurosciences.The brain is one of the most
               complex organs, and tools are lacking to assess its
               cellular morphology in vivo. Here we combine original
               diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy
               acquisition and novel modeling strategies to explore the
               possibility of quantifying brain cell morphology
               noninvasively. First, the diffusion of cell-specific
               metabolites is measured at ultra-long diffusion times in
               the rodent and primate brain in vivo to observe how cell
               long-range morphology constrains metabolite diffusion.
               Massive simulations of particles diffusing in synthetic
               cells parameterized by morphometric statistics are then
               iterated to fit experimental data. This method yields
               synthetic cells (tentatively neurons and astrocytes) that
               exhibit striking qualitative and quantitative similarities
               with histology (e.g., using Sholl analysis). With our
               approach, we measure major interspecies difference
               regarding astrocytes, whereas dendritic organization
               appears better conserved throughout species. This work
               suggests that the time dependence of metabolite diffusion
               coefficient allows distinguishing and quantitatively
               characterizing brain cell morphologies noninvasively.},

  abstract  = {This paper aims to identify the minimum requirements for
               an accurate model of the diffusion MR signal in white
               matter of the brain. We construct a taxonomy of
               multi-compartment models of white matter from combinations
               of simple models for the intra- and the extra-axonal
               spaces. We devise a new diffusion MRI protocol that
               provides measurements with a wide range of imaging
               parameters for diffusion sensitization both parallel and
               perpendicular to white matter fibres. We use the protocol
               to acquire data from two fixed rat brains, which allows us
               to fit, study and compare the different models. The study
               examines a total of 47 analytic models, including several
               well-used models from the literature, which we place within
               the taxonomy. The results show that models that incorporate
               intra-axonal restriction, such as ball and stick or
               CHARMED, generally explain the data better than those that
               do not, such as the DT or the biexponential models.
               However, three-compartment models which account for
               restriction parallel to the axons and incorporate pore size
               explain the measurements most accurately. The best fit
               comes from combining a full diffusion tensor (DT) model of
               the extra-axonal space with a cylindrical intra-axonal
               component of single radius and a third spherical
               compartment of non-zero radius. We also measure the
               stability of the non-zero radius intra-axonal models and
               find that single radius intra-axonal models are more stable
               than gamma distributed radii models with similar fitting

@article{paulsen2010,
  abstract  = {\{NMR\} and \{MRI\} can yield detailed chemical and
               dynamic information about flow at microscopic resolutions,
               but suffer from low signal to noise relative to alternative
               techniques for flow measurements. In porous media and
               microfluidic devices, this sensitivity problem is further
               exacerbated by magnetic susceptibility broadening and low
               coil filling factor. Fortunately, remote detection can
               mitigate these issues by physically separating signal
               detection from the other steps of the experiment. The
               technique requires, however, that any measured interactions
               be encoded in indirectly sampled dimensions, leading to
               experiments of high dimensionality and correspondingly long
               acquisition times. We have applied compressed sensing, a
               reconstruction technique used in MRI, to dramatically
               reduce these experiment times by 8–64× through partial
               sampling (sub-sampling) of k-space, allowing for the
               collection of images with significantly higher resolutions
               in reasonable amounts of time. Here, we demonstrate this
               reconstruction technique to remotely detected flow
               measurements in a serpentine mixing chip and in a
               microfluidic channel harboring a constriction. We find that
               compressed sensing allows for significantly higher
               resolution images to be collected in a practical amount of
               time, thus significantly enhancing the applicability of
               remote detection to flow imaging. },

@article{penrose1990,
  abstract  = {A general framework is given for the phenomenological
               kinetics of phase transitions in which not only the order
               parameter but also the temperature may vary in time and
               space. Instead of a Ginzburg-Landau free energy functional,
               as used in formulating the Cahn-Hilliard equation, we use
               the analogous entropy functional. Model entropy
               functionals, and the kinetic equations resulting from them,
               are constructed for various cases: phase transitions with
               and without a critical point, and (in the former case) with
               or without a latent heat. The class considered is general
               enough to include the entropy functionals for the Ising
               model in mean-field approximation, the van der Waals fluid,
               and a simplified version of the density-functional theory
               of freezing. A case without critical point, for which the
               energy is conserved but the order parameter is not,
               provides a thermodynamically consistent derivation of the
               phase-field equations studied by Caginalp, Fix and others,
               and also leads in a natural way to the Lyapunov functional
               given by Langer for these equations; but the treatment also
               suggests that a modified version of the phase-field
               equations might provide a more realistic model of
               freezing.},

  abstract  = {The paper discusses a model for anomalous diffusion
               processes. Their one-point probability density functions
               (p.d.f.) are exact solutions of fractional diffusion
               equations. The model reflects the asymptotic behavior of a
               jump (anomalous random walk) process with random jump sizes
               and random inter-jump time intervals with infinite means
               (and variances) which do not satisfy the Law of Large
               Numbers. In the case when these intervals have a fractional
               exponential p.d.f., the fractional Komogorovâ€“Feller
               equation for the corresponding anomalous diffusion is
               provided and methods of finding its solutions are
               discussed. Finally, some statistical properties of

  abstract  = {The influence of finite length gradient pulses on NMR
               diffusion experiments on liquids confined to diffuse
               between two parallel planes is investigated. It is
               experimentally verified that the pore size decreases when
               determined using finite gradient pulses if the results are
               analyzed within the short gradient pulse approximation. The
               results are analyzed using the matrix formulation. The
               observed minima in the echo decay profiles are considerably
               less sharp than theoretical analysis would indicate and we
               suggest that this is due to the presence of a distribution
               of pore sizes in the sample. In addition, effects due to
               the presence of background gradients are discussed. It is
               argued that effects due to the finite length gradient
               pulses are relatively minor and in realistic applications
               the effects due to inhomogeneities in pore sizes and
               effects due to background gradients will constitute more
               serious problems in pore size determinations by means of

               using a phase-field model computed on an adaptive, finite
               element grid. We discuss the details of our algorithm and
               show that it greatly reduces the computational cost of
               solving the phase-field model at low undercooling. In
               particular, we show that the computational complexity of
               solving any phase-boundary problem scales with the
               interface arclength when using an adapting mesh. Moreover,
               the use of dynamic data structures allows us to simulate
               system sizes corresponding to experimental conditions,
               which would otherwise require lattices greater than
               217×217elements. We examine the convergence properties of
               our algorithm. We also present two-dimensional,
               time-dependent calculations of dendritic evolution, with
               and without surface tension anisotropy. We benchmark our
               results for dendritic growth with microscopic solvability
               theory, finding them to be in good agreement with theory
               for high undercoolings. At low undercooling, however, we
               obtain higher values of velocity than solvability theory at
               low undercooling, where transients dominate, in accord with
               a heuristic criterion which we derive.},

  abstract  = {Background: Iron can catalyze damaging free radical
               reactions. With age, iron accumulates in brain gray matter
               regions and may contribute to the risk of developing
               age-related diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD).
               Prior MRI studies demonstrated increased iron deposits in
               basal ganglia regions; however, the hippocampus (Hipp),
               which is heavily damaged in AD, and comparator regions that
               are resistant to AD damage, such as thalamus (Th), have
               rarely been examined. Objective: To assess iron levels and
               evidence of tissue damage in Hipp and Th of AD subjects and
               healthy controls. Methods: Thirty-one AD and sixty-eight
               healthy control subjects participated in this study. High-
               and low-field strength MRI instruments were used in
               combination to quantify iron content of ferritin molecules
               (ferritin iron) using the field dependent relaxation rate
               increase (FDRI) method. Decreased transverse relaxation
               rate (R 2 ) was used as an index of tissue damage. Results:
               Compared with healthy controls, AD subjects had increased
               ferritin iron in Hipp (p = 0.019) but not Th (p = 0.637),
               and significantly decreased R 2 in Hipp (p &lt; 0.001) but
               not Th (p = 0.37). In the entire sample, FDRI and R 2 were
               negatively correlated. Conclusion: The data shows that in
               AD, Hipp damage occurs in conjunction with ferritin iron
               accumulation. Prospective studies are needed to evaluate
               how increasing iron levels may influence the trajectory of
               tissue damage and cognitive and pathologic manifestations
               of AD.},

              approximation for crossing fascicles, i.e., the assumption
              that the total diffusion-weighted MRI signal is the sum of
              the signals arising from each fascicle independently, even
              when the fascicles intermingle in a voxel. Methods Monte
              Carlo simulations were used to study the impact of the
              approximation on the diffusion-weighted MRI signal and to
              assess whether this approximate model allows
              microstructural features of interwoven fascicles to be
              accurately estimated, despite signal differences. Results
              Small normalized signal differences were observed,
              typically . The use of the approximation had little impact
              on the estimation of the crossing angle, the axonal density
              index, and the radius index in clinically realistic
              scenarios wherein the acquisition noise was the predominant
              source of errors. In the absence of noise, large systematic
              errors due to the superposition approximation only
              persisted for the radius index, mainly driven by a low
              sensitivity of diffusion-weighted MRI signals to small
              radii in general. Conclusion The use of the superposition
              approximation rather than a model of interwoven fascicles

  abstract = {Many closed-form analytical models have been proposed to relate the diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) signal to microstructural features of white matter tissues. These models generally make assumptions about the tissue and the diffusion processes which often depart from the biophysical reality, limiting their reliability and interpretability in practice. Monte Carlo simulations of the random walk of water molecules are widely recognized to provide near groundtruth for DW-MRI signals. However, they have mostly been limited to the validation of simpler models rather than used for the estimation of microstructural properties. This work proposes a general framework which leverages Monte Carlo simulations for the estimation of physically interpretable microstructural parameters, both in single and in crossing fascicles of axons. Monte Carlo simulations of DW-MRI signals, or fingerprints, are pre-computed for a large collection of microstructural configurations. At every voxel, the microstructural parameters are estimated by optimizing a sparse combination of these fingerprints. Extensive synthetic experiments showed that our approach achieves accurate and robust estimates in the presence of noise and uncertainties over fixed or input parameters. In an in vivo rat model of spinal cord injury, our approach provided microstructural parameters that showed better correspondence with histology than five closed-form models of the diffusion signal: MMWMD, NODDI, DIAMOND, WMTI and MAPL. On whole-brain in vivo data from the human connectome project (HCP), our method exhibited spatial distributions of apparent axonal radius and axonal density indices in keeping with ex vivo studies. This work paves the way for microstructure fingerprinting with Monte Carlo simulations used directly at the modeling stage and not only as a validation tool.},

@article{reveleye2820,
  abstract  = {It is widely recognized that studying the detailed anatomy
               of the human brain is of great importance for neuroscience
               and medicine. The principal means for achieving this goal
               is presently diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI)
               tractography, which uses the local diffusion of water
               throughout the brain to estimate the course of long-range
               anatomical projections. Such projections connect gray
               matter regions through axons that travel in the deep white
               matter. The present study combines dMRI tractography with
               histological analysis to investigate where in the brain
               this method succeeds and fails. We conclude that certain
               superficial white matter systems pose challenges for
               measuring cortical connections that must be overcome for
               accurate determination of detailed neuroanatomy in
               humans.In vivo tractography based on diffusion magnetic
               resonance imaging (dMRI) has opened new doors to study
               structure{\textendash}function relationships in the human
               brain. Initially developed to map the trajectory of major
               white matter tracts, dMRI is used increasingly to infer
               long-range anatomical connections of the cortex. Because
               axonal projections originate and terminate in the gray
               matter but travel mainly through the deep white matter, the
               success of tractography hinges on the capacity to follow
               fibers across this transition. Here we demonstrate that the
               complex arrangement of white matter fibers residing just
               under the cortical sheet poses severe challenges for
               long-range tractography over roughly half of the brain. We
               investigate this issue by comparing dMRI from
               very-high-resolution ex vivo macaque brain specimens with
               histological analysis of the same tissue. Using
               probabilistic tracking from pure gray and white matter
               seeds, we found that \~{}50\% of the cortical surface was
               effectively inaccessible for long-range diffusion tracking
               because of dense white matter zones just beneath the
               infragranular layers of the cortex. Analysis of the
               corresponding myelin-stained sections revealed that these
               zones colocalized with dense and uniform sheets of axons
               running mostly parallel to the cortical surface, most often
               in sulcal regions but also in many gyral crowns. Tracer
               injection into the sulcal cortex demonstrated that at least
               some axonal fibers pass directly through these fiber
               systems. Current and future high-resolution dMRI studies of
               the human brain will need to develop methods to overcome
               the challenges posed by superficial white matter systems to
               determine long-range anatomical connections accurately.},

@article{reynaud2017,
  abstract = {In diffusion weighted imaging (DWI), the apparent
              diffusion coefficient has been recognized as a useful and
              sensitive surrogate for cell density, paving the way for
              non-invasive tumor staging, and characterization of
              treatment efficacy in cancer. However, microstructural
              parameters, such as cell size, density and/or compartmental
              diffusivities affect diffusion in various fashions, making
              of conventional DWI a sensitive but non-specific probe into
              changes happening at cellular level.
              
              Alternatively, tissue complexity can be probed and
              quantified using the time dependence of diffusion metrics,
              sometimes also referred to as temporal diffusion
              spectroscopy when only using oscillating diffusion
              gradients. Time-dependent diffusion (TDD) is emerging as a
              strong candidate for specific and non-invasive tumor
              characterization.
              
              Despite the lack of a general analytical solution for all
              diffusion times / frequencies, TDD can be probed in various
              regimes where systems simplify in order to extract relevant
              information about tissue microstructure. The fundamentals
              of TDD are first reviewed (a) in the short time regime,
              disentangling structural and diffusive tissue properties,
              and (b) near the tortuosity limit, assuming weakly
              heterogeneous media near infinitely long diffusion times.
              
              Focusing on cell bodies (as opposed to neuronal tracts), a
              simple but realistic model for intracellular diffusion can
              offer precious insight on diffusion inside biological
              systems, at all times. Based on this approach, the main
              three geometrical models implemented so far (IMPULSED,
              POMACE, VERDICT) are reviewed. Their suitability to
              quantify cell size, intra- and extracellular spaces (ICS
              and ECS) and diffusivities are assessed.
              
              The proper modeling of tissue membrane permeability –
              hardly a newcomer in the field, but lacking applications -
              and its impact on microstructural estimates are also
              considered. After discussing general issues with tissue
              modeling and microstructural parameter estimation (i.e.
              fitting), potential solutions are detailed.
              
              The in vivo applications of this new, non-invasive,
              specific approach in cancer are reviewed, ranging from the
              characterization of gliomas in rodent brains and
              observation of time-dependence in breast tissue lesions and
              prostate cancer, to the recent preclinical evaluation of
              new treatments efficacy. It is expected that clinical
              applications of TDD will strongly benefit the community in
              terms of non-invasive cancer screening.},

               refined meshes for the simulation of binary alloy
               solidification in 2D is presented. In addition we combine a
               second-order fully implicit time discretisation scheme with
               variable step size control to obtain an adaptive time and
               space discretisation method. The superiority of this
               method, compared to widely used fully explicit methods,
               with respect to CPU time and accuracy, is shown. Due to the
               high nonlinearity of the governing equations a robust and
               fast solver for systems of nonlinear algebraic equations is
               needed to solve the intermediate approximations per time
               step. We use a nonlinear multigrid solver which shows
               almost h-independent convergence behaviour.},

               linear equations in three mutually orthogonal displacements
               of points of its median surface, are considered. Damping
               features of the plate are determined by fractional
               derivatives with respect to time. Viscosity is referred to
               modal character. The Laplace integral transform method is
               employed as a method of solution, which is followed by the
               expansion of the desired functions in series with respect
               to eigenfunctions of the problem. However, unlike in the
               traditional approach, when rationalization of a
               characteristic equation with fractional powers is carried
               out during the transition from image to pre-image, here the
               nonrationalized characteristic equation is solved by the
               method suggested by the authors. The solution is obtained
               in the form of the sum of two terms, one of which governs
               the drift of the system's equilibrium position and is
               defined by the quasi-static processes of creep occurring in
               the system, and the other term describes damped vibrations
               around the equilibrium position and is determined by the
               systems's inertia and energy dissipation. The influence of
               viscosity on the solution is shown, and the time dependence
               of the plate points displacements is analyzed.},

  abstract  = {When studying water diffusion in biological systems, any
               specific signal attenuation curve may be reproduced by a
               broad range of mathematical functions. Our goals were to
               quantify the diffusion and T 2 relaxation properties of
               water in a simple biological system and to study the
               changes that occur in osmotically stressed cells. Human
               breast cancer cells were incubated in isotonic or hypotonic
               osmotic buffers. Diffusion-weighted and T 2 -weighted
               magnetic resonance images were acquired during
               sedimentation over 12 h. Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI)
               data were analyzed with a biexponential fit, the KÃ¤rger
               model for exchange between two freely diffusing populations
               and the Price-modified KÃ¤rger model accounting for
               restricted diffusion in spherical geometry. We found that
               only the Price model provided an accurate quantitative
               description for water diffusion in both cell systems,
               independent of acquisition parameters, over the entire
               density range. Model-derived cell radii, intracellular
               volume fractions and transmembrane water exchange times
               were in good agreement with results calculated from light
               microscopy and with model-free exchange times. T 2 data
               indicated two populations in fast exchange, with volume
               fractions clearly different from DWI populations. Hypotonic
               stress led to higher slow apparent diffusion coefficient,
               longer T 2 and lower membrane permeability. The tortuosity
               in a hypotonic cell suspension complied with the Wang model
               for spherical geometry. Quantitative characterization of
               biological systems is obtainable by DWI, using appropriate
               modeling, accounting for water restriction and exchange
               between compartments.},

  abstract = {An investigation has been made of the relation between
              axon diameter, fibre diameter, and myelin sheath thickness
              in myelinated nerve fibres from the peroneal nerve of the
              rabbit. Fibres were measured: (a) in the normal nerve, and
              (b) during regeneration following nerve crushing. In the
              normal nerve, fibres ranging in diameter from 1 to 20 $\mu
              $ were present. These had axons with diameters from 0.5
              $\mu $ in the smallest, to about 15 $\mu $ in the largest
              fibres. The 0.5 $\mu $ axons had myelin sheaths about 0.5
              $\mu $ thick, while the largest axons had sheaths about 2.5
              $\mu $ thick. Between these extremes the curve relating
              sheath thickness to axon diameter was at first steep, and
              then more gradual in slope. In regenerating nerve fibres 15
              mm. proximal to the site of lesion the axons decline
              steadily in diameter during the first period of
              regeneration (100 days). Thereafter they increase in size,
              although even after 300 days the largest axons have not
              regained their normal diameter. The axons, 10 mm. below the
              lesion, extremely thin at their first appearance, increase
              steadily in diameter, until, 300 days after injury they
              equal in diameter the axons of the proximal stump. The
              decrease in diameter of axons proximally is accompanied by
              an absolute increase in their myelin sheath thickness. This
              takes place first of all without any alteration in the
              total diameter of the fibres concerned, the increase in
              thickness of the myelin compensating the decrease in axon
              diameter. Between 60 and 100 days after injury, however,
              continuing axon decrease is accompanied by a decrease in
              the total diameter of the fibres. Between 100 and 200 days
              an increase in total fibre diameter parallels the increase
              in axon diameter, the myelin sheaths remaining abnormally
              thick. Between 200 and 300 days after injury the continued
              increase in axon diameter causes a diminution in myelin
              sheath thickness. Even at 300 days after injury, however,
              the sheaths are still thicker than in normal nerve. In the
              distal stump the myelin sheaths, when first developed, are
              thicker than those of fibres of corresponding diameter in
              normal nerve. Subsequently they grow still thicker,
              reaching their maximum thickness about 200 days after nerve
              injury. Between 200 and 300 days a slight diminution in
              sheath thickness occurs since the axons continue to
              increase while the total diameter remains the same.
              However, even at 300 days the sheaths are still thicker
              than normal. The bearing of these results on the nature of
              the forces maintaining the structure of nerve fibres is
              discussed.},

               the mean-square displacement is proportional to some other
               power of time. In the presence of moderate concentrations
               of obstacles, diffusion is anomalous over short distances

               are used to characterize anomalous diffusion for obstacle

               As the obstacle concentration approaches the percolation
               threshold, diffusion becomes more anomalous over longer
               distances; the anomalous diffusion exponent and the

               age-dependent low signal intensity in many extrapyramidal
               nuclei. Although it has been suggested that this low
               intensity results from non-haem iron, the specific
               influence of non-haem iron on the T2 relaxation time has
               not been quantified and remains controversial. The T2
               relaxation times of the globus pallidus and putamen were
               measured from MRI at 1.5T in 27 healthy patients, by using
               a mathematical model. They were then plotted as a function
               of age and compared to the curve of age-dependent iron
               concentration determined post mortem. The curves of T2
               relaxation time in the basal ganglia are congruent with
               published curves of iron concentration, indicating a high
               probability that the changes in T2 relaxation times and the
               low signal in the basal ganglia result from the local,
               age-dependent iron deposition. Individual measurements of
               T2 relaxation time show less variation before than after 45
               years of age, indicating the influence of a second, more

  abstract  = {Abstract The ability of diffusion \{MRI\} (dMRI) fiber
               tractography to non-invasively map three-dimensional (3D)
               anatomical networks in the human brain has made it a
               valuable tool in both clinical and research settings.
               However, there are many assumptions inherent to any
               tractography algorithm that can limit the accuracy of the
               reconstructed fiber tracts. Among them is the assumption
               that the diffusion-weighted images accurately reflect the
               underlying fiber orientation distribution (FOD) in the
               \{MRI\} voxel. Consequently, validating dMRI's ability to
               assess the underlying fiber orientation in each voxel is
               critical for its use as a biomedical tool. Here, using
               post-mortem histology and confocal microscopy, we present a
               method to perform histological validation of orientation
               functions in 3D, which has previously been limited to
               two-dimensional analysis of tissue sections. We demonstrate
               the ability to extract the 3D \{FOD\} from confocal
               z-stacks, and quantify the agreement between the \{MRI\}
               estimates of orientation information obtained using
               constrained spherical deconvolution (CSD) and the true
               geometry of the fibers. We find an orientation error of
               approximately 6° in voxels containing nearly parallel
               fibers, and 10–11° in crossing fiber regions, and note
               that \{CSD\} was unable to resolve fibers crossing at
               angles below 60° in our dataset. This is the first time
               that the 3D white matter orientation distribution is
               calculated from histology and compared to dMRI. Thus, this
               technique serves as a gold standard for dMRI validation
               studies — providing the ability to determine the extent
               to which the dMRI signal is consistent with the
               histological FOD, and to establish how well different dMRI
               models can predict the ground truth FOD. },

  abstract  = {Diffusion-weighted MRI can rapidly detect acute cerebral
               ischemic injury as hyperintense signal changes, reflecting
               a decline in the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of
               water through brain parenchyma, whereas ADC is elevated in
               the chronic stage because of increased extracellular water
               content. To determine the time course of these ADC changes,
               we analyzed 157 diffusion-weighted MRI studies performed at
               varying time points from the initial ischemic event from
               101 patients. Data were expressed as the relative ADC
               (rADC), the ratio of lesion to control regions of interest.
               We observed two phases in the time course of rADC changes
               in acute human stroke: a significant (p < 0.005) reduction
               in rADC lasting for at least 96 hours from stroke onset
               (mean, 58.3% of control; SEM, 1.47) and an increasing trend
               from reduction to pseudonormalization to elevation of rADC
               values at later subacute to chronic time points (â‰¥7
               days). We suggest that the persistent reduction of rADC
               within the first four days may reflect ongoing or
               progressive cytotoxic edema to a greater degree than
               extracellular edema and cell lysis.},

               numerical scheme for dynamic systems containing fractional
               derivatives, Journal of Vibration and Acoustics 124 (2002)
               321-324] presented a new numerical scheme to calculate the
               dynamic response of mechanical systems, the damping forces
               of which are described by fractional derivatives. When
               solving the resulting equation of motion by time
               integration, it is necessary to store the entire
               displacement history of the system due to the non-local
               character of the fractional derivatives. The cited scheme
               appears to overcome this drawback by transforming the
               equation of motion with the fractional term into a set of
               ordinary differential equations. It can be shown that this
               scheme is equivalent to a classical spring-dashpot
               representation and thus does not imply the benefits derived
               from fractional-derivative models. In addition, it is less

  abstract = {Abstract One of the hallmarks of diffusion NMR and MRI is
              its ability to utilize restricted diffusion to probe
              compartments much smaller than the excited volume or the
              MRI voxel, respectively, and to extract microstructural
              information from them. Single-pulsed field gradient (s-PFG)
              MR methodologies have been employed with great success to
              probe microstructures in various disciplines, ranging from
              chemistry to neuroscience. However, s-PFG MR also suffers
              from inherent shortcomings, especially when specimens are
              characterized by orientation or size distributions: in such
              cases, the microstructural information available from s-PFG
              experiments is limited or lost. Double-pulsed field
              gradient (d-PFG) MR methodology, an extension of s-PFG MR,
              has attracted attention owing to recent theoretical studies
              predicting that it can overcome certain inherent
              limitations of s-PFG MR. In this review, we survey the
              microstructural features that can be obtained from
              conventional s-PFG methods in the different q regimes, and
              highlight its limitations. The experimental aspects of
              d-PFG methodology are then presented, together with an
              overview of its theoretical underpinnings and a general
              framework for relating the MR signal decay and material
              microstructure, affording new microstructural parameters.
              We then discuss recent studies that have validated the
              theory using phantoms in which the ground truth is well
              known a priori, a crucial step prior to the application of
              d-PFG methodology in neuronal tissue. The experimental
              findings are in excellent agreement with the theoretical
              predictions and reveal, inter alia, zero-crossings of the
              signal decay, robustness towards size distributions and
              angular dependences of the signal decay from which accurate
              microstructural parameters, such as compartment size and
              even shape, can be extracted. Finally, we show some initial
              findings in d-PFG MR imaging. This review lays the
              foundation for future studies, in which accurate and novel
              microstructural information could be extracted from complex
              biological specimens, eventually leading to new forms of
              contrast in MRI. Copyright © 2010 John Wiley & Sons,

  abstract = {Stejskal and Tanner's ingenious pulsed field gradient
              design from 1965 has made diffusion NMR and MRI the
              mainstay of most studies seeking to resolve microstructural
              information in porous systems in general and biological
              systems in particular. Methods extending beyond Stejskal
              and Tanner's design, such as double diffusion encoding
              (DDE) NMR and MRI, may provide novel quantifiable metrics
              that are less easily inferred from conventional diffusion
              acquisitions. Despite the growing interest on the topic,
              the terminology for the pulse sequences, their parameters,
              and the metrics that can be derived from them remains
              inconsistent and disparate among groups active in DDE.
              Here, we present a consensus of those groups on terminology
              for DDE sequences and associated concepts. Furthermore, the
              regimes in which DDE metrics appear to provide
              microstructural information that cannot be achieved using
              more conventional counterparts (in a model-free fashion)
              are elucidated. We highlight in particular DDE's potential
              for determining microscopic diffusion anisotropy and
              microscopic fractional anisotropy, which offer metrics of
              microscopic features independent of orientation dispersion
              and thus provide information complementary to the standard,
              macroscopic, fractional anisotropy conventionally obtained
              by diffusion MR. Finally, we discuss future vistas and
              perspectives for DDE. Magn Reson Med 75:82–87, 2016. ©

  abstract = {High-resolution imaging of human autopsy tissues may
              improve our understanding of in vivo MRI findings, but
              interpretation is complicated because samples are obtained
              by immersion fixation following a postmortem interval
              (PMI). This study tested the hypotheses that immersion
              fixation and PMI's from 0–24 h would alter the water
              relaxation and diffusion properties in rat cortical slice
              and spinal cord models of human nervous tissue. Diffusion
              data collected from rat cortical slices at multiple
              diffusion times (10–60 ms) and b-values (7–15,000
              s/mm2) were analyzed using a two-compartment model with
              exchange. Rat spinal cords were characterized with standard
              diffusion tensor imaging (21 directions, b=1250 s/mm2).
              Switching from perfusion- to immersion-fixation at 0 h PMI
              altered most MRI properties of rat cortical slices and
              spinal cords, including a 22% decrease in fractional
              anisotropy (P<0.001). After 4 h PMI, cortical slice T1 and
              T2 increased 22% and 65% respectively (P<0.001),
              transmembrane water exchange decreased 23% (P<0.001) and
              intracellular proton fraction increased 25% (P=0.002).
              After 6 h PMI, spinal cord white matter fractional
              anisotropy had decreased 38% (P<0.001). MRI property
              changes were observed for PMIs up to 24 h. The MRI changes
              correlated with protease activity and histopathological
              signs of autolysis. Thus, immersion fixation and/or even
              short PMIs (4–6 h) altered the MRI properties of rat
              nervous tissue. This suggests comparisons between in vivo
              clinical MRI and MRI data from human autopsy tissues should
              be interpreted with caution.},

  abstract  = {Abstract&nbsp;&nbsp;Ordinary differential equations (ODEs)
               with fractional order derivatives are infinite dimensional
               systems and nonlocal in time: the history of the state
               variable is needed to calculate the instantaneous rate of
               change. This nonlocal nature leads to expensive long-time
               computations (O(t 2) computations for solution up to time
               t). A finite dimensional approximation of the fractional
               order derivative can alleviate this problem. We present one
               such approximation using a Galerkin projection. The
               original infinite dimensional system is replaced with an
               equivalent infinite dimensional system involving a partial
               differential equation (PDE). The Galerkin projection
               reduces the PDE to a finite system of ODEs. These ODEs can
               be solved cheaply (O(t) computations). The shape functions
               used for the Galerkin projection are important, and given
               attention. The approximation obtained is specific to the
               fractional order of the derivative; but can be used in any
               system with a derivative of that order. Calculations with
               both global shape functions as well as finite elements are
               presented. The discretization strategy is improved in a few
               steps until, finally, very good performance is obtained
               over a user-specifiable frequency range (not including
               zero). In particular, numerical examples are presented
               showing good performance for frequencies varying over more
               than 7 orders of magnitude. For any discretization held
               fixed, however, errors will be significant at sufficiently
               low or high frequencies. We discuss why such asymptotics
               may not significantly impact the engineering utility of the
               method.},

  abstract  = {Myelin loss and axonal damage are both observed in white
               matter injuries. Each may have significant impact on the
               long-term disability of patients. Currently, there does not
               exist a noninvasive biological marker that enables
               differentiation between myelin and axonal injury. We
               describe herein the use of magnetic resonance diffusion
               tensor imaging (DTI) to quantify the effect of
               dysmyelination on water directional diffusivities in brains
               of shiverer mice in vivo. The principal diffusion
               eigenvalues of eight axonal fiber tracts that can be
               identified with certainty on \{DTI\} maps were measured.
               The water diffusivity perpendicular to axonal fiber tracts,
               λ⊥, was significantly higher in shiverer mice compared
               with age-matched controls, reflecting the lack of myelin
               and the increased freedom of cross-fiber diffusion in white
               matter. The water diffusivity parallel to axonal fiber
               tracts, λ∥, was not different, which is consistent with
               the presence of intact axons. It is clear that
               dysmyelination alone does not impact λ∥. The presence of
               intact axons in the setting of incomplete myelination was
               confirmed by electron microscopy. Although further
               validation is still needed, our finding suggests that
               changes in λ⊥ and λ∥ may potentially be used to
               differentiate myelin loss versus axonal injury. },

              5-year effort to map human brain connections and their
              variability in healthy adults. A consortium of HCP
              investigators will study a population of 1200 healthy
              adults using multiple imaging modalities, along with
              extensive behavioral and genetic data. In this overview, we
              focus on diffusion MRI (dMRI) and the structural
              connectivity aspect of the project. We present recent
              advances in acquisition and processing that allow us to
              obtain very high-quality in-vivo MRI data, whilst enabling
              scanning of a very large number of subjects. These advances
              result from 2years of intensive efforts in optimising many
              aspects of data acquisition and processing during the
              piloting phase of the project. The data quality and methods
              described here are representative of the datasets and
              processing pipelines that will be made freely available to
              the community at quarterly intervals, beginning in 2013.},

  abstract            = {We consider the well-posedness and exponential
                         stabilizability of the abstract Volterra
                         integrodifferential system v'(t) = - D* ? (t) + f(t),
                         $\sigma (t) = \nu Dv(t) + \int^t_{- \infty} a(t -
                         s)Dv(s)ds, \quad t \geq 0,$ in a Hilbert space. In a
                         typical viscoelastic interpretation of this equation one
                         lets v represent velocity, v' acceleration, ? stress, -D* ?
                         the divergence of the stress, ? ? 0 pure viscosity (usually
                         equal to zero), Dv the time derivative of the strain, and a
                         the linear stress relaxation modulus of the material. The
                         problems that we treat are one-dimensional in the sense
                         that we require a to be scalar. First we prove
                         well-posedness in a new semigroup setting, where the
                         history component of the state space describes the absorbed
                         energy of the system rather than the history of the
                         function v. To get the well-posedness we need extremely
                         weak assumptions on the kernel; it suffices if the system
                         is "passive", i.e., a is of positive type; it may even be a
                         distribution. The system is exponentially stabilizable with
                         a finite dimensional continuous feedback if and only if the
                         essential growth rate of the original system is negative.
                         Under additional assumptions on the kernel we prove that
                         this is indeed the case. The final part of the treatment is
                         based on a new class of kernels. These kernels are of
                         positive type, but they need not be completely monotone.
                         Still, they have many properties similar to those of
                         completely monotone kernels, and a number of results that
                         have been proved earlier for completely monotone kernels
                         can be extended to the new class.},

  abstract  = {Diffusion in the extracellular space (ECS) of the brain is
               constrained by the volume fraction and the tortuosity and a
               modified
               
               diffusion equation represents the transport behavior of
               many molecules in the brain. Deviations from the equation
               reveal loss
               
               of molecules across the blood-brain barrier, through
               cellular uptake, binding, or other mechanisms. Early
               diffusion measurements
               
               used radiolabeled sucrose and other tracers. Presently, the
               real-time iontophoresis (RTI) method is employed for small
               ions
               
               and the integrative optical imaging (IOI) method for
               fluorescent macromolecules, including dextrans or proteins.
               Theoretical
               
               models and simulations of the ECS have explored the
               influence of ECS geometry, effects of dead-space
               microdomains, extracellular
               
               matrix, and interaction of macromolecules with ECS
               channels. Extensive experimental studies with the RTI
               method employing
               
               the cation tetramethylammonium (TMA) in normal brain tissue
               show that the volume fraction of the ECS typically is
               âˆ¼20% and the tortuosity is âˆ¼1.6 (i.e., free
               diffusion coefficient of TMA is reduced by 2.6), although
               there are regional variations. These parameters
               
               change during development and aging. Diffusion properties
               have been characterized in several interventions, including
               brain
               
               stimulation, osmotic challenge, and knockout of
               extracellular matrix components. Measurements have also
               been made during ischemia,
               
               in models of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, and in
               human gliomas. Overall, these studies improve our
               conception of
               
               ECS structure and the roles of glia and extracellular
               matrix in modulating the ECS microenvironment. Knowledge of
               ECS diffusion
               
               properties is valuable in contexts ranging from
               understanding extrasynaptic volume transmission to the
               development of paradigms
               
               for drug delivery to the brain.},

  abstract  = {Diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) tractography is widely used
               to map structural connections of the human brain in vivo
               and has been adopted by large-scale initiatives such as the
               human connectome project. Our results indicate that, even
               with high-quality data, DWI tractography alone is unlikely
               to provide an anatomically accurate map of the brain
               connectome. It is crucial to complement tractography
               results with a combination of histological or
               neurophysiological methods to map structural connectivity
               accurately. Our findings, however, do not diminish the
               importance of diffusion MRI as a noninvasive tool that
               offers important quantitative measures related to brain
               tissue microstructure and white matter
               architecture.Tractography based on diffusion-weighted MRI
               (DWI) is widely used for mapping the structural connections
               of the human brain. Its accuracy is known to be limited by
               technical factors affecting in vivo data acquisition, such
               as noise, artifacts, and data undersampling resulting from
               scan time constraints. It generally is assumed that
               improvements in data quality and implementation of
               sophisticated tractography methods will lead to
               increasingly accurate maps of human anatomical connections.
               However, assessing the anatomical accuracy of DWI
               tractography is difficult because of the lack of
               independent knowledge of the true anatomical connections in
               humans. Here we investigate the future prospects of
               DWI-based connectional imaging by applying advanced
               tractography methods to an ex vivo DWI dataset of the
               macaque brain. The results of different tractography
               methods were compared with maps of known axonal projections
               from previous tracer studies in the macaque. Despite the
               exceptional quality of the DWI data, none of the methods
               demonstrated high anatomical accuracy. The methods that
               showed the highest sensitivity showed the lowest
               specificity, and vice versa. Additionally, anatomical
               accuracy was highly dependent upon parameters of the
               tractography algorithm, with different optimal values for
               mapping different pathways. These results suggest that
               there is an inherent limitation in determining long-range
               anatomical projections based on voxel-averaged estimates of
               local fiber orientation obtained from DWI data that is
               unlikely to be overcome by improvements in data acquisition
               and analysis alone.},

  abstract = {Principles from multidimensional NMR spectroscopy, and in
              particular solid-state NMR, have recently been transferred
              to the field of diffusion MRI, offering non-invasive
              characterization of heterogeneous anisotropic materials,
              such as the human brain, at an unprecedented level of
              detail. Here we revisit the basic physics of solid-state
              NMR and diffusion MRI to pinpoint the origin of the
              somewhat unexpected analogy between the two fields, and
              provide an overview of current diffusion MRI acquisition
              protocols and data analysis methods to quantify the
              composition of heterogeneous materials in terms of
              diffusion tensor distributions with size, shape, and
              orientation dimensions. While the most advanced methods
              allow estimation of the complete multidimensional
              distributions, simpler methods focus on various projections
              onto lower-dimensional spaces as well as determination of
              means and variances rather than actual distributions. Even
              the less advanced methods provide simple and intuitive
              scalar parameters that are directly related to
              microstructural features that can be observed in optical
              microscopy images, e.g. average cell eccentricity, variance
              of cell density, and orientational order – properties
              that are inextricably entangled in conventional diffusion
              MRI. Key to disentangling all these microstructural
              features is MRI signal acquisition combining isotropic and
              directional dimensions, just as in the field of
              multidimensional solid-state NMR from which most of the
              ideas for the new methods are derived.},

@article{tsaig2006,
  abstract  = {We study the notion of compressed sensing (CS) as put
               forward by Donoho, Candes, Tao and others. The notion
               proposes a signal or image, unknown but supposed to be
               compressible by a known transform, (e.g. wavelet or
               Fourier), can be subjected to fewer measurements than the
               nominal number of data points, and yet be accurately
               reconstructed. The samples are nonadaptive and measure
               ‘random’ linear combinations of the transform
               coefficients. Approximate reconstruction is obtained by
               solving for the transform coefficients consistent with
               measured data and having the smallest possible ℓ 1 norm.
               We present initial ‘proof-of-concept’ examples in the
               favorable case where the vast majority of the transform
               coefficients are zero. We continue with a series of
               numerical experiments, for the setting of ℓ p -sparsity,
               in which the object has all coefficients nonzero, but the
               coefficients obey an ℓ p bound, for some p ∈ ( 0 , 1 ]
               . The reconstruction errors obey the inequalities
               paralleling the theory, seemingly with well-behaved
               constants. We report that several workable families of
               ‘random’ linear combinations all behave equivalently,
               including random spherical, random signs, partial Fourier
               and partial Hadamard. We next consider how these ideas can
               be used to model problems in spectroscopy and image
               processing, and in synthetic examples see that the
               reconstructions from \{CS\} are often visually “noisy”.
               To suppress this noise we post-process using
               translation-invariant denoising, and find the visual
               appearance considerably improved. We also consider a
               multiscale deployment of compressed sensing, in which
               various scales are segregated and \{CS\} applied separately
               to each; this gives much better quality reconstructions
               than a literal deployment of the \{CS\} methodology. These
               results show that, when appropriately deployed in a
               favorable setting, the \{CS\} framework is able to save
               significantly over traditional sampling, and there are many
               useful extensions of the basic idea. },

  abstract  = {AbstractPurpose Linear least squares estimators are widely
               used in diffusion MRI for the estimation of diffusion
               parameters. Although adding proper weights is necessary to
               increase the precision of these linear estimators, there is
               no consensus on how to practically define them. In this
               study, the impact of the commonly used weighting strategies
               on the accuracy and precision of linear diffusion parameter
               estimators is evaluated and compared with the nonlinear
               least squares estimation approach. Methods Simulation and
               real data experiments were done to study the performance of
               the weighted linear least squares estimators with weights
               defined by (a) the squares of the respective noisy
               diffusion-weighted signals; and (b) the squares of the
               predicted signals, which are reconstructed from a previous
               estimate of the diffusion model parameters. Results The
               negative effect of weighting strategy (a) on the accuracy
               of the estimator was surprisingly high. Multi-step
               weighting strategies yield better performance and, in some
               cases, even outperformed the nonlinear least squares
               estimator. Conclusion If proper weighting strategies are
               applied, the weighted linear least squares approach shows
               high performance characteristics in terms of
               accuracy/precision and may even be preferred over nonlinear
               estimation methods.},

  abstract = {Biophysical modeling of macroscopic diffusion-weighted MRI
              signal in terms of microscopic cellular parameters holds
              the promise of quantifying the integrity of white matter.
              Unfortunately, even fairly simple multi-compartment models
              of proton diffusion in the white matter do not provide a
              unique, biophysically plausible solution. Here we report a
              nontrivial diffusion MRI signal dependence on echo time
              (TE) in human white matter in vivo. We demonstrate that
              such TE dependence originates from compartment-specific T2
              values and that it is a promising “orthogonal measure”
              able to break the degeneracy in parameter estimation, and
              to yield important relaxation metrics robustly. We thereby
              enable the precise estimation of the intra- and
              extra-axonal water T2 relaxation times, which is precluded
              by a limited signal-to-noise ratio when using multi-echo
              relaxometry alone.},

Physics and physiology limit the resolution of human MRI to be orders of magnitude coarser than cell dimensions. Here we identify and quantify the MRI signal coming from within micrometer-thin axons in human white matter tracts in vivo, by utilizing the sensitivity of diffusion MRI to Brownian motion of water molecules restricted by cell walls. We study a specific power-law scaling of the diffusion MRI signal with the diffusion weighting, predicted for water confined to narrow axons, and quantify axonal water fraction and orientation dispersion.},

              solutes with their partition coefficients between water and
              four organic solvents. High correlations were observed with
              hexadecane and olive oil (r=0.95 and 0.93), but not octanol
              and ether (r=0.75 and 0.74). Permeabilities of the seven
              smallest molecules (mol wt <50) (water, hydrofluoric acid,
              hydrochloric acid, ammonia, methylamine, formic acid and
              formamide) were 2- to 15-fold higher than the values
              predicted by the permeabilities of the larger molecules
              (50<mol wt<300). The ``extra'' permeabilities of the seven
              smallest molecules were not correlated with partition
              coefficients but were inversely correlated with molecular
              volumes. The larger solute permeabilities also decreased
              with increasing molecular volume, but the relationship was
              neither steep nor significant. The permeability pattern
              cannot be explained by the molecular volume dependence of
              partitioning into the bilayer or by the existence of
              transient aqueous pores. The molecular volume dependence of
              solute permeability suggests that the membrane barrier
              behaves more like a polymer than a liquid hydrocarbon. All
              the data are consistent with the ``solubility-diffusion''

              and the molecular volume dependence of nonelectrolyte

               disease (AD) by analyzing 16-scalp electrodes EEG signals
               and make a comparison with the normal controls. The power
               spectral density (PSD) which represents the power
               distribution of EEG series in the frequency domain is used
               to evaluate the abnormalities of AD brain. Spectrum
               analysis based on autoregressive Burg method shows that the
               relative PSD of AD group is increased in the theta
               frequency band while significantly reduced in the alpha2
               frequency bands, particularly in parietal, temporal, and
               occipital areas. Furthermore, the coherence of two EEG
               series among different electrodes is analyzed in the alpha2
               frequency band. It is demonstrated that the pair-wise
               coherence between different brain areas in AD group are
               remarkably decreased. Interestingly, this decrease of
               pair-wise electrodes is much more significant in
               inter-hemispheric areas than that in intra-hemispheric
               areas. Moreover, the linear cortico-cortical functional
               connectivity can be extracted based on coherence matrix,
               from which it is shown that the functional connections are
               obviously decreased, the same variation trend as relative
               PSD. In addition, we combine both features of the relative
               PSD and the normalized degree of functional network to
               discriminate AD patients from the normal controls by
               applying a support vector machine model in the alpha2
               frequency band. It is indicated that the two groups can be
               clearly classified by the combined feature. Importantly,
               the accuracy of the classification is higher than that of
               any one feature. The obtained results show that analysis of
               PSD and coherence-based functional network can be taken as
               a potential comprehensive measure to distinguish AD
               patients from the normal, which may benefit our
               understanding of the disease.},

@article{wang2015a,
  abstract  = {Abstract.Â Quantitative investigations of fiber
               orientation and structural connectivity at microscopic
               resolution have led to great challenges for current
               neuroimaging techniques. Here, we present a structure
               tensor (ST) analysis of ex vivo rat brain images acquired
               by a multicontrast (MC) serial optical coherence scanner.
               The ST considers the gradients of images in local neighbors
               to generate a matrix whose eigen-decomposition can estimate
               the local features such as the edges, anisotropy, and
               orientation of tissue constituents. This computational
               analysis is applied on the conventional- and
               polarization-based contrasts of optical coherence
               tomography. The three-dimensional (3-D) fiber orientation
               maps are computed from the image stacks of sequential scans
               both at mesoresolution for a global view and at
               high-resolution for the details. The computational
               orientation maps demonstrate a good agreement with the
               optic axis orientation contrast which measures the in-plane
               fiber orientation. Moreover, tractography is implemented
               using the directional information extracted from the 3-D
               ST. The study provides a unique opportunity to leverage MC
               high-resolution information to map structural connectivity
               of the whole brain.},

  abstract  = {Rapid MRI of the molecular diffusion of water demonstrated
               cerebral infarcts in 32 patients. We studied these patients
               at various times following the onset of ischemic symptoms
               and found that diffusion-weighted imaging revealed the
               infarcts sooner than conventional T2-weighted spin-echo
               imaging did; four hyperacute infarcts were shown only by
               diffusion-weighted imaging. Acute infarcts had lower
               apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) than noninfarcted
               regions did. This relative difference in ADC reached a
               nadir in the first 24 hours and rose progressively
               thereafter. Chronic infarcts showed a relative increase in
               diffusion and were readily distinguishable from acute
               infarcts. The technique takes less than 2 minutes to apply
               using a standard 1.5-tesla scanner in the clinical setting.
               Diffusion-weighted imaging has the potential to play a role
               in improving the early anatomic diagnosis of stroke and
               therefore in the development and implementation of early
               stroke interventions.},

  abstract = {The simulation of diffusion by Monte Carlo methods is
              often essential to describing NMR measurements of diffusion
              in porous media. However, simulation timescales must often
              span hundreds of milliseconds, with large numbers of
              trajectories required to ensure statistical convergence.
              Here we demonstrate that by parallelising code to run on
              graphics processing units (GPUs), these calculations may be
              accelerated by over three orders of magnitude, opening new
              frontiers in experimental design and analysis. As such
              cards are commonly installed on most desktop computers, we

  abstract  = {The nucleus is one of the most prominent cellular
               organelles, yet surprisingly little is known about how it
               is formed, what determines its shape and what defines its
               size. As the nuclear envelope (NE) disassembles in each and
               every cell cycle in metazoans, the process of rebuilding
               the nucleus is crucial for proper development and cell
               proliferation. In this Commentary, we summarize what is
               known about the regulation of nuclear shape and size, and
               highlight recent findings that shed light on the process of
               building a nucleus, including new discoveries related to NE
               assembly and the relationship between the NE and the

  abstract  = {Our laboratory and others have reported the ability to
               detect individual Alzheimer's disease (AD) amyloid plaques
               in transgenic mouse brain in vivo by magnetic resonance
               imaging (MRI). Since amyloid plaques contain iron, most MRI
               studies attempting to detect plaques in AD transgenic mouse
               brain have employed techniques that exploit the
               paramagnetic effect of iron and have had mixed results. In
               the present study, using five-way anatomic spatial
               coregistration of MR images with three different
               histological techniques, properties of amyloid plaques in
               AD transgenic mouse brain were revealed that may explain
               their variable visibility in gradient- and spin-echo MR
               images. The results demonstrate differences in the
               visibility of plaques in the cortex and hippocampus,
               compared to plaques in the thalamus, by the different MRI
               sequences. All plaques were equally detectable by T2SE,
               while only thalamic plaques were reliably detectable by
               T2*GE pulse sequences. Histology revealed that
               cortical/hippocampal plaques have low levels of iron while
               thalamic plaques have very high levels. However, the
               paramagnetic effect of iron does not appear to be the sole
               factor leading to the rapid decay of transverse
               magnetization (short T2) in cortical/hippocampal plaques.
               Accordingly, MRI methods that rely less on iron magnetic
               susceptibility effect may be more successful for eventual
               human AD plaque MR imaging, particularly since human AD
               plaques more closely resemble the cortical and hippocampal
               plaques of AD transgenic mice than thalamic plaques.},

  abstract  = {A phase field model is used to numerically simulate the
               solidification of a pure material. We employ it to compute
               growth into an undercooled liquid for a one-dimensional
               spherically symmetric geometry and a planar two-dimensional
               rectangular region. The phase field model equation are
               solved using finite difference techniques on a uniform
               mesh. For the growth of a sphere, the solutions from the
               phase field equations for sufficiently small interface
               widths are in good agreement with a numerical solution to
               the classical sharp interface model obtained using a
               Green's function approach. In two dimensions, we simulate
               dendritic growth of nickel with four-fold anisotropy and
               investigate the effect of the level of anisotropy on the
               growth of a dendrite. The quantitative behavior of the
               phase field model is evaluated for varying interface
               thickness and spatial and temporal resolution. We find
               quantitatively that the results depend on the interface
               thickness and with the simple numerical scheme employed it
               is not practical to do computations with an interface that
               is sufficiently thin for the numerical solution to
               accurately represent a sharp interface model. However, even
               with a relatively thick interface the results from the
               phase field model show many of the features of dendritic
               growth and they are in surprisingly good quantitative
               agreement with the Ivantsov solution and microscopic
               solvability theory.},

  abstract  = {An improved finite difference (FD) method has been
               developed in order to calculate the behaviour of the
               nuclear magnetic resonance signal variations caused by
               water diffusion in biological tissues more accurately and
               efficiently. The algorithm converts the conventional
               image-based finite difference method into a convenient
               matrix-based approach and includes a revised periodic
               boundary condition which eliminates the edge effects caused
               by artificial boundaries in conventional FD methods.
               Simulated results for some modelled tissues are consistent
               with analytical solutions for commonly used
               diffusion-weighted pulse sequences, whereas the improved FD
               method shows improved efficiency and accuracy. A tightly
               coupled parallel computing approach was also developed to
               implement the FD methods to enable large-scale simulations
               of realistic biological tissues. The potential applications
               of the improved FD method for understanding diffusion in

               large number of experimental results related to the
               structure of the diffusion-attenuated MR signal in
               biological systems is introduced. The theoretical framework
               relies on a phenomenological model that introduces a
               distribution function for tissue apparent diffusion
               coefficients (ADC). It is shown that at least two
               parametersÂ -Â the position of distribution maxima (ADC)
               and the distribution width (?)Â -Â are needed to describe
               the MR signal in most regions of a human brain. A
               substantial distribution width, on the order of 36% of the
               ADC, was found for practically all brain regions examined.
               This method of modeling the MR diffusion measurement allows
               determination of an intrinsic tissue-specific ADC for a
               given diffusion time independent of the strength of
               diffusion sensitizing gradients. The model accounts for the
               previously found biexponential behavior of the
               diffusion-attenuated MR signal in CNS. Magn Reson Med

               of an integrated, generalized, and efficient Monte Carlo
               simulation system for diffusion magnetic resonance imaging
               (dMRI), named Diffusion Microscopist Simulator (DMS). DMS
               comprises a random walk Monte Carlo simulator and an MR
               image synthesizer. The former has the capacity to perform
               large-scale simulations of Brownian dynamics in the virtual
               environments of neural tissues at various levels of
               complexity, and the latter is flexible enough to synthesize
               dMRI datasets from a variety of simulated MRI pulse
               sequences. The aims of DMS are to give insights into the
               link between the fundamental diffusion process in
               biological tissues and the features observed in dMRI, as
               well as to provide appropriate ground-truth information for
               the development, optimization, and validation of dMRI
               acquisition schemes for different applications. The
               validity, efficiency, and potential applications of DMS are
               evaluated through four benchmark experiments, including the
               simulated dMRI of white matter fibers, the multiple
               scattering diffusion imaging, the biophysical modeling of
               polar cell membranes, and the high angular resolution
               diffusion imaging and fiber tractography of complex fiber
               configurations. We expect that this novel software tool
               would be substantially advantageous to clarify the
               interrelationship between dMRI and the microscopic
               characteristics of brain tissues, and to advance the
               biophysical modeling and the dMRI methodologies.</p>},

  abstract  = {Direct measurement of tissue microstructure with diffusion
               MRI offers a new class of markers, such as axon diameters,
               that give more specific information about tissue than
               measures derived from diffusion tensor imaging. The
               existing techniques of this kind assume a single axon
               orientation in the tissue model, which may be a reasonable
               approximation only for the most coherently oriented brain
               white matter, such as the corpus callosum. For most other
               areas, orientation dispersion is not negligible and, if
               unaccounted for, leads to overestimation of the axon
               diameters, prohibiting their accurate mapping over the
               whole brain. Here we propose a new model that captures the
               effect of orientation dispersion explicitly. A numerical
               scheme is developed to compute the diffusion signal
               prescribed by the proposed model efficiently, which
               supports the simultaneous estimation of the axon diameter
               and orientation dispersion. Synthetic data experiments
               demonstrate that the new model provides an axon diameter
               index that is robust to the presence of orientation
               dispersion. Results on in vivo human data show reduced axon
               diameter index and better agreement with histology compared
               to previous methods suggesting improvements in the axon
               diameter estimate.},

  abstract  = {This paper introduces neurite orientation dispersion and
               density imaging (NODDI), a practical diffusion MRI
               technique for estimating the microstructural complexity of
               dendrites and axons in vivo on clinical MRI scanners. Such
               indices of neurites relate more directly to and provide
               more specific markers of brain tissue microstructure than
               standard indices from diffusion tensor imaging, such as
               fractional anisotropy (FA). Mapping these indices over the
               whole brain on clinical scanners presents new opportunities
               for understanding brain development and disorders. The
               proposed technique enables such mapping by combining a
               three-compartment tissue model with a two-shell
               high-angular-resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) protocol
               optimized for clinical feasibility. An index of orientation
               dispersion is defined to characterize angular variation of
               neurites. We evaluate the method both in simulation and on
               a live human brain using a clinical 3T scanner. Results
               demonstrate that NODDI provides sensible neurite density
               and orientation dispersion estimates, thereby disentangling
               two key contributing factors to FA and enabling the
               analysis of each factor individually. We additionally show
               that while orientation dispersion can be estimated with
               just a single HARDI shell, neurite density requires at
               least two shells and can be estimated more accurately with
               the optimized two-shell protocol than with alternative
               two-shell protocols. The optimized protocol takes about 30
               min to acquire, making it feasible for inclusion in a
               typical clinical setting. We further show that sampling
               fewer orientations in each shell can reduce the acquisition
               time to just 10 min with minimal impact on the accuracy of
               the estimates. This demonstrates the feasibility of NODDI
               even for the most time-sensitive clinical applications,
               such as neonatal and dementia imaging.},

  abstract  = {A two-dimensional finite element method capable of
               tracking sharp interfaces is developed. The method is based
               on a fixed mesh of bilinear isoparametric elements and is
               extremely simple and easy to use. The interfaces are
               tracked with a set of marker points that define their
               position at all times. Several different approaches to
               finding the interface position and velocity are discussed,
               and their effect on the convergence rate is examined. It is
               shown through numerical examples that the approximation to
               the interface position converges with second-order accuracy
               in two-dimensional problems, as opposed to previously
               developed finite difference algorithms that are only
               first-order accurate. The approximation to the interface
               velocity is shown to be of first order. A number of
               examples are examined, including several that provide a

  abstract  = {A pulsed-gradient spin-echo method has been used to
               measure the water self-diffusion coefficient in various
               media containing susceptibility variations arising from the
               presence of superparamagnetic iron oxide particles. These
               include aqueous suspensions, polyacrylamide gels, and rat
               livers. The results for each medium indicate that, contrary
               to intuition, the apparent diffusion coefficient decreases
               as the iron particle concentration increases. A simple
               theoretical model has been developed to interpret the data.
               This model relates the changes in apparent diffusion to the
               variance of the internal gradient distribution generated by
               the iron particles. A computer simulation of nuclei
               undergoing a random walk in an inhomogeneous medium was
               performed and the results provide qualitative confirmation
               of the experimental observations. The relevance of these
               phenomena to measurements of molecular diffusion in
               heterogeneous systems and their use to estimate internal
               gradient strengths are discussed.},

Generate a large number of possible cell centers.

Compute the \soutnew{}{minimum} distance, $d$, between the current center and previously accepted cells.

Find the intersection of [$d-d_\text{max} r_\text{mean}$, $d-d_\text{min} r_\text{mean}$] and $[r_\text{min}, r_\text{max}]$, where $r_\text{mean}=\frac{r_\text{min}+r_\text{max}}{2}$. If the intersection is not empty, then take the middle of the intersection as the new radius and accept the new center. Otherwise, reject the center.

Loop through the possible centers until get $N_\text{cell}$ accepted cells.
